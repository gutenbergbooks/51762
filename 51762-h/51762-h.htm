</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is at least one spot in the world where
Fairies are still believed in, and where, if you look in the right
places, they may still be found, and that is the little island from
which these stories come&mdash;Ellan Vannin, the Isle of Mann. But I
have used a word which should not be mentioned here&mdash;they are
never called Fairies by the Manx, but Themselves, or the Little People,
or the Little Fellows, or the Little Ones, or sometimes even the
Lil&rsquo; Boys. These Little People are not the tiny creatures with
wings who flutter about in many English Fairy tales, but they are small
persons from two to three feet in height, otherwise very like mortals.
They wear red caps and green jackets and are very fond of
hunting&mdash;indeed they are most often seen on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e149" href="#xd21e149" name=
"xd21e149">iv</a>]</span>horseback followed by packs of little hounds
of all the colours of the rainbow. They are rather inclined to be
mischievous and spiteful, and that is why they are called by such good
names, in case they should be listening!</p>
<p class="par">Besides these red-capped Little Fellows there are other
more alarming folk. There is the Fynoderee, who is large, ugly, hairy
and enormously strong, but not so bad as he looks, for often he helps
on the farm during the night by thrashing corn. He does not like to be
seen, so if a farmer wants work done by him, he must take care to keep
out of the Fynoderee&rsquo;s way. Then, far uglier than Fynoderee, are
the Bugganes, who are horrible and cruel creatures. They can appear in
any shape they please&mdash;as ogres with huge heads and great fiery
eyes, or without any heads at all; as small dogs who grow larger and
larger as you watch them until they are larger than elephants, when
perhaps they turn into the shape of men or disappear into nothing; as
horned monsters or anything they choose. Each <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e153" href="#xd21e153" name=
"xd21e153">v</a>]</span>Buggane has his own particular
dwelling-place&mdash;a dark sea-cave, a lonely hill, or a ruined
Keeill, or Church. There are many others too, but these are the
chief.</p>
<p class="par">Most of the stories are traditional and have been handed
down by word of mouth from father to son. I owe hearty thanks to those
from whose lips I have heard them&mdash;Messrs. J. R. Moore, William
Cashen, Joe Moore, Ned Quayle and others. Of the four stories which
have not been told to me personally&mdash;Teeval, Kitterland, The
Wizard&rsquo;s Palace, and Smereree&mdash;the three first have been
printed in various folk-lore books, and the Manx of the last appeared
in &lsquo;Yn Lioar Manninagh&rsquo; some years ago. Lastly I must thank
my friend Miss Alice Williams for her kind help and valuable assistance
in many ways.</p>

<p class="par first">There was a man once in the Isle of Mann who met
one of the Little Fellows, and the Little Fellow told him that if he
would go to London Bridge and dig, he would find a fortune. So he went,
and when he got there he began to dig, and another man came to him and
said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;One of Themselves told me to come to London
Bridge and I would get a fortune,&rsquo; says he. And the other man
said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I dreamed that I was back in the lil&rsquo;
islan&rsquo; an&rsquo; I was at a house with a thorn-tree at the
chimley of it, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=

wouldn&rsquo; go, for it was only foolishness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he told him so plainly about the house that the
first man knew it was his own, so he went back to the Island. When he
got home he dug under the little thorn-tree by the chimney and he found
an iron box. He opened the box and it was full of gold, and there was a
letter in it, but he could not read the letter because it was in a
foreign language. So he put it in the smithy window and challenged any
scholar who went by to read it. None of them could, but at last one big
boy said it was Latin and it meant:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Dig again and you&rsquo;ll find
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the man dug again under the thorn-tree, and what did
he find but another iron box full of gold!</p>
<p class="par">And from that day till the day of his death, that man
used to open the front door before going to bed, and call out:

<p class="par first">Here is a true story that was told me by a man
named James Moore when I was sitting with him by the fire one evening.
He said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not much of a believer in most of the
stories some ones is telling, but after all a body can&rsquo;t help
believing a thing they happen to see for themselves.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I remember one winter&rsquo;s night&mdash;we were
living in a house at the time that was pulled down for the building of
the Big Wheel. It was a thatched house with two rooms, and a wall about
six foot high dividing them, and from that it was open to the scrahs,
or turfs, that were laid across the rafters. My Mother was sitting at
the fire busy spinning, and my Father was sitting in the big chair at
the end of the table taking a chapter for us out of the Manx Bible. My
brother was busy winding a spool and I was working with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>a bunch of
ling, trying to make two or three pegs.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a terrible glisther on
to-night,&rdquo; my Mother said, looking at the fire. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
the rain comin&rsquo; peltin&rsquo; down the chimley!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my Father, shutting the
Bible; &ldquo;an&rsquo; we better get to bed middlin&rsquo; soon and
let the Lil&rsquo; Ones in to a bit of shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;So we all got ready and went to bed.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Some time in the night my brother wakened me with
a:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;&ldquo;Sh&mdash;ish! Listen boy, an&rsquo; look
at the big light tha&rsquo;s in the kitchen!&rdquo; Then he rubbed his
eyes a bit and whispered:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s mother doin&rsquo; now at
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll hear mother in bed, it&rsquo;s not her at all; it must be
the Little Ones that&rsquo;s agate of the wheel!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;And both of us got frightened, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>down with
our heads under the clothes and fell asleep. In the morning when we got
up we told them what we had seen, first thing.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;&ldquo;Aw, like enough, like enough,&rdquo; my
Father said, looking at the wheel. &ldquo;It seems your mother forgot
to take the band off last night, a thing people should be careful
about, for it&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; Themselves power over the wheel,
an&rsquo; though their meanin&rsquo;s well enough, the spinnin&rsquo;
they&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; is nothin&rsquo; to brag about. The weaver is
always shoutin&rsquo; about their work an&rsquo; the bad joinin&rsquo;
they&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; in the rolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;&ldquo;I remember it as well as
yesterday&mdash;the big light that was at them, and the whirring that
was going on. And let anybody say what they like, that&rsquo;s a thing
I&rsquo;ve seen and heard for myself.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p class="par first">One evening a young man who was serving his time
as a weaver was walking home late from Douglas to Glen Meay. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>had often been boasting that he had never seen any
of the Little People. Well, this night he was coming along the St.
John&rsquo;s Road, and when he got near to the river a big, big bull
stood across the road before him. He took his stick and gave it one big
knock. It went into the river and he never saw it any more.</p>
<p class="par">After that, when he got to the Parson&rsquo;s Bridge, he
met a little thing just like a spinning wheel and there was a little,
little body sitting where the spool is. Well, he lifted his stick again
and struck the little body that was sitting on the spool a hard knock
with his stick. The little body said to him:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Ny jean shen arragh!&rsquo; which means,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that again!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">He walked on then till he got to Glen Meay and told what
he had seen in a house there. Then another man said he had seen the
little old woman sitting on the top of the spool of the spinning wheel
and coming down Raby Hill at dark. So it took her a long time, for the
first man met her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>at six and the second at eleven, and there
isn&rsquo;t two miles between the two places.</p>
<p class="par">So they were saying, when the cycles came in, that the
Little People had been before them! And this is a true story.

<h2 class="main">THE BUGGANE OF GLEN MEAY WATERFALL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There was once a woman living near Glen Meay, and
she was the wife of a decent, quiet, striving man of the place. There
was no one but herself and the man, and they had a nice little cottage
and owned a bit of a croft on which they grazed a cow and a few sheep
and grew enough potatoes to do them the winter out; and the man had a
yawl and went to the fishing when things were slack on land. But for
all that they were not comfortable, for work as hard as the man might
at his farming and his fishing, he was kept as poor as Lazarus by a
lazy wife.</p>
<p class="par">For the woman was fonder of lying a-bed in the morning
than sitting at her milking stool; indeed the neighbours had it to say
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>that she wore out more blankets than shoes. Many a
day her man would be going out early as hungry as a hawk, without a
bite or a sup in him. One morning when he came in from work for his
breakfast there was no fire&mdash;his wife was never up. Well, my poor
man had nothing for it but to get his own breakfast ready and go back
to his work. When he came in for dinner it happened as it had happened
for breakfast.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Bad luck to her laziness,&rsquo; he thought;
&lsquo;this is coul comfort for a poor man, but I&rsquo;ll play a trick
on her for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And with that he fetched a bart of straw and bunged the
two windows of his house. Then he went back to his work.</p>
<p class="par">The sun had not yet set when he came home in the
evening. His wife was lying in bed waiting for day.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, woman,&rsquo; he shouted, &lsquo;make haste
an&rsquo; get up to see the sun rise in the wes&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Up jumped the wife and ran to the door just as the sun
was going down, and the sight terrified her. The whole sky looked like
fire, and she thought that the end of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>the world had come. But
next morning it all happened as it had happened before, and himself
said to her:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Kirry, it&rsquo;s the Buggane, sure enough,
that&rsquo;ll be having thee one of these days if thou don&rsquo;t mend
thy ways!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What Buggane?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Ax me no questions,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell thee no lies. But it&rsquo;s the big,
black, hairy fellow that lies under the Spooyt Vooar that I&rsquo;m
meanin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, houl yer tongue, man; thou don&rsquo;t
frecken me wi&rsquo; thy Bugganes,&rsquo; shouted the woman.</p>
<p class="par">In the evening the man left the house to go out to the
fishing. As soon as he had gone the woman took a notion in her head to
bake, as she had only the heel o&rsquo; the loaf left for breakfast.
Now, Themselves can&rsquo;t stand lazy ways, and baking after sunset is
the one thing they won&rsquo;t abide. She who does so will meet their
revenge&mdash;something is sure to be taken by them, but seldom worse
than some of the live stock. Well, the woman set to work to bake some
barley <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>bread and flour cake. First, she went out to get
gorse to put under the griddle, slipping the bolt on the door as she
came in, that none of the neighbours would catch her and cry shame on
her for baking after sunset. She got some meal out of the barrel and
put it on the round table, and put salt and water on it, and then she
kneaded the meal and clapped a cake out as thin as sixpence with her
hands. But she was only a middling poor baker, one of the sort that has
to use a knife to make the cake of a right round. She had turned the
cake twice, and taken it off, and brushed the griddle with a white
goose wing ready for the next cake which she was busy cutting round
with her knife. Just at that moment there was heard the sound of
something heavy lumbering up to the door. After a few seconds
<span class="sc">SOMETHING</span> fumbled at the sneg of the door, then
<span class="sc">SOMETHING</span> knocked high up on the door, and a
voice like the thick, gruff voice of a giant was heard saying,
&lsquo;Open, open for me.&rsquo; She made no answer. Again there was a
loud knock and a big hoarse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>voice was heard which cried:
&lsquo;Woman of the house, open for me.&rsquo; Then the door burst open
and behold ye, what should she see but a great, big ugly beast of a
Buggane rushing in mad with rage. Without as much as a &lsquo;By your
leave,&rsquo; he made one grab at her, and clutched hold of her by her
apron and swung her on his shoulder, and away with him. Before she knew
where she was he rushed her across the fields and down the hill, till
he brought her to the top of the Spooyt Vooar, the big waterfall of
Glen Meay. As the Buggane tore down the hill, the woman felt the ground
tremble under his feet, and the noise of the waterfall filled her ears.
And, there in front of her, she saw the stream turn to white spray as
it came leaping down the rocks. As the Buggane swung her in the air to
throw her into the deep pool, she thought that her last hour had come.
Then all at once she remembered the knife that she held in her hand!
Quick as thought she cut the string of her apron and down she tumbled
to the ground, rolling over and over down the hill. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>And
before he knew where he was the Buggane, with the speed he had on him,
pitched forward head first down the rushing Spooyt Vooar. As he went
head over heels and down to the bottom of the pool with a souse
you&rsquo;d have heard half a mile away, she heard him give a roar out
of him:</p>

<p class="par">&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s out is out, and who&rsquo;s in is
in!&rsquo; And with that he was just closing the door when the cat came
running up, half drowned&mdash;that&rsquo;s why cats hate the
water&mdash;and just squeezed in, in time. But Noah had slammed the
door as she ran in and it cut off her tail, so she got in without it,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=

<h2 class="main">THE MAKING OF MANN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Thousands of years ago, at the time of the Battles
of the Giants in Ireland, Finn Mac Cooil was fighting with a great,
red-haired Scotch giant who had come over to challenge him. He beat him
and chased him eastwards towards the sea. But the Scotch giant was a
faster runner and began to get ahead of him, so Finn, who was afraid
that he would jump into the sea and escape, stooped down and clutched a
great handful of the soil of Ireland to throw at him. He cast it, but
he missed his enemy, and the great lump of earth fell into the midst of
the Irish Sea. It is the Isle of Mann, and the great hole which Finn
made, where he tore it up, is Lough Neagh.</p>
<p class="par">There were men, too, in Ireland in those days as well as
giants, and to some of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>it seemed to happen in a different
way. Men do not always understand the doings of giants, because men
live, it may be said, in the footprints of the giants. It seems that at
this time the Irish tribes were gathered in two great forces getting
ready to meet the plunderers who had left Scotland and were at work on
their own coast. Their blood got too hot and they went into each other
in downright earnest, to show how they would do with the rascals when
they came. To their confusion, for they lost hold over themselves, they
got into boggy ground and were in great danger. The leaders, seeing
that it was going to mean a big loss of life, got all their men
together on a big patch of dry ground that happened to be in the
bog-land, when all of a sudden a darkness came overhead and the ground
began to shake and tremble with the weight of the people and the stir
there was at them, and then it disappeared, people and all. Some said
that it took plunge and sank into the bog with the people on it. Others
said that it was lifted up, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>and the people on it dropped off into
the swamp. No doubt the darkness that was caused by the hand of Finn
made it hard to see just how it happened. However that may be, a while
after this they said the sea was surging dreadful, and the men in the
boats had to hold to the sides, or it&rsquo;s out they&rsquo;d have
been thrown. And behold ye, a few days after this there was land seen
in the middle of the sea, where no man ever saw the like before.</p>
<p class="par">You may know that this story is true because the Irish
have always looked on the Isle of Mann as a parcel of their own land.
They say that when Saint Patrick put the blessing of God on the soil of
Ireland and all creatures that might live upon it, the power of that
blessing was felt at the same time in the Island.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Saint Patrick was a mighty man,</p>
<p class="line">He was a Saint so clever,</p>
<p class="line">He gave the snakes and toads a twisht!</p>
<p class="line">And banished them for ever.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">And there is proof of the truth of the saying to
this day, for while such nasty things do <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>live in England they
cannot breathe freely on the blessed soil.</p>
<p class="par">The island was much larger then than it is now, but the
magician who for a time ruled over it, as a revenge on one of his
enemies, raised a furious wind in the air and in the bosom of the
earth. This wind tore several pieces off the land and cast them into
the sea. They floated about and were changed into the dangerous rocks
which are now so much feared by ships. The smaller pieces became the
shifting sands which wave round the coast, and are sometimes seen and
sometimes disappear. Later the island was known as Ellan Sheaynt, the
Isle of Peace, or the Holy Island. It was a place where there was
always sunshine, and the singing of birds, the scent of sweet flowers,
and apple-trees blossoming the whole year round. There was always
enough there to eat and drink, and the horses of that place were fine
and the women beautiful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=

<h2 class="main">THE COMING OF SAINT PATRICK</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was the time that Saint Patrick was coming on
horseback to Mann, over the sea from Ireland. When he drew near to the
land, Manannan Mac y Leirr, that great wizard that was ruler of Mann,
put a charm out of him that made the air round the island thick with
mist, so that neither sun nor sky nor sea nor land could be seen.
Patrick rode into the thick of the mist, but try as he would he could
find no way out of it, and behind him there was a great sea-beast
waiting to swallow him up. He didn&rsquo;t know in his seven senses
where he was&mdash;east, or west&mdash;and was for turning back, when
there came to his ears the cry of a curlew, calling:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Come you, come you, come you!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he said to himself:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;The curlew will be down feeding among the rocks;
she will be calling to her young.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">After that he heard the bleat of a goat:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Beware, beware, beware!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And he said to himself:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Where the goat bleats for the fall of her kid
there will be a steep bit of a hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Last of all he heard the crow of a cock:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Come to us&mdash;come, come!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then said Patrick:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I believe on me sowl I&rsquo;m back of Peel
Hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And with that he took one leap on to the little island
and put his horse up the sheer rock. Soon he stood, sure enough, at the
top of Peel Hill. As he stood there he cried out:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Me blessing on the curlew. No man afther this is
to find her nest!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Me blessing on the goat, an&rsquo; no man is to
see her bring forth her young!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Me blessing on the cock, an&rsquo; he shall crow
at dawn ever afther at this same hour!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">He cursed the sea beast and turned him into a solid rock
and there he lies now with his great fin on his back.</p>
<p class="par">Where the horse&rsquo;s hoofs struck the top of the hill
there sprang a well of pure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href=
"#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>water, of which man and horse drank,
and it is called the Holy Well of Saint Patrick to this day. If you go
down to the ledges of the rock, which were made by the horse&rsquo;s
hoofs as he clambered up, you may see the footprints still.</p>
<p class="par">When Patrick looked about him the mist was lifting, and
he saw a great host of warriors round Manannan&rsquo;s Faery Mound,
with the first rays of the rising sun shining on their spears. But the
saint knew that they were phantoms raised by Manannan&rsquo;s magic
power and he bade them to be gone.</p>
<p class="par">And, behold, they and their master, in the shape of
three-legged men, whirled round and round like wheels before the swift
wind, which could not overtake them, till they came to Spanish Head.
There they whirled over the houghs so quickly and lightly that the
gulls on the ledges below were not disturbed, then on over the rough,
grey Irish Sea till they came to the enchanted island, fifteen miles
south-west of the Calf. Once there Manannan dropped the isle to the
bottom of the sea, and he and his company were seen no more.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Saint Patrick on his snow-white horse stood still on
Peel Hill and blessed the island where he had touched land, and blessed
it has been to this day. Then he leapt on to the little islet that he
saw below him. Ever since it has been called Saint Patrick&rsquo;s
Isle, and from the rocks on its northern side he watched the fierce
storm which Manannan&rsquo;s going had made. Just then a brave ship,
with foresail and mainsail gone, was driving straight for the terrible
rocks. Saint Patrick raised his mailed hand and the tempest was calmed.
The good ship righted herself again, and those on board were saved.
They looked up with awe and thankfulness at the rider in his shining
armour on the snow-white steed, standing bright against the blackness
of the rocks. And ever since that day the fisherman, as he sails past
the Horse Rock, has offed with his cap and put up this bit of a prayer
to good Saint Patrick:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Saint Patrick who blessed our Island, bless us and our

<h2 class="main">HOW THE HERRING BECAME KING OF THE SEA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The old fishermen of the island have it to say
that years and years ago the fish met to choose themselves a king, for
they had no deemster to tell them what was right. Likely enough their
meeting-place was off the Shoulder, south of the Calf. They all came
looking their best&mdash;there was Captain Jiarg, the Red Gurnet, in
his fine crimson coat; Grey Horse, the Shark, big and cruel; the Bollan
in his brightest colours; Dirty Peggy, the Cuttle-fish, putting her
nicest face on herself; Athag, the Haddock, trying to rub out the black
spots the devil burnt on him when he took hold of him with his finger
and thumb, and all the rest. Each one thought he might be chosen.</p>
<p class="par">The Fish had a strong notion to make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>Brac
Gorm, the Mackerel, king. He knew that, and he went and put beautiful
lines and stripes on himself&mdash;pink and green and gold, and all the
colours of the sea and sky. Then he was thinking diamonds of himself.
But when he came he looked that grand that they didn&rsquo;t know him.
So they said that he was artificial and would have nothing to do with
him.</p>
<p class="par">In the end it was Skeddan, the Herring, the Lil Silver
Fella, who was made King of the Sea.</p>
<p class="par">When it was all over, up came the Fluke, too late to
give his vote, and they all called out:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve missed the tide, my
beauty!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">It seems that he had been so busy tallivating himself
up, touching himself up red in places, that he forgot how time went.
When he found that the herring had been chosen, he twisted up his mouth
on one side, and says he:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;An&rsquo; what am I goin&rsquo; to be
then?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Take that,&rsquo; says Scarrag the Skate, and he
ups with his tail and gives the Fluke <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>a slap on his mouth that
knocked his mouth crooked on him. And so it has been ever since.</p>
<p class="par">And, maybe, it&rsquo;s because the Herring is King of
the Sea that he has so much honour among men. Even the deemsters, when
they take their oath, say: &lsquo;I will execute justice as
indifferently as the herring&rsquo;s backbone doth lie in the midst of
the fish.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And the Manx people will not burn the herring&rsquo;s
bones in the fire, in case the herring should feel it. It is to be
remembered, too, that the best herring in the world are caught in this
place off the Shoulder, where the fish held their big meeting, and that
is because it is not very far from Manannan&rsquo;s enchanted island.

<h2 class="main">THE SILVER CUP</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There was once a man living in the south of the
island whose name was Colcheragh. He was a farmer, and he had poultry
on his street, sheep on the mountain, and cattle in the meadow land
alongside the river.</p>
<p class="par">His cows were the best cows in the parish. Nowhere could
you see such a fine head of cattle as he had; they were the pride of
his heart, and they served him well with milk and butter.</p>
<p class="par">But after a time he began to think that something was
amiss with the cows. He went to the cow-house the first thing every
morning, and one morning he noticed the cows looking so tired they
could hardly stand. When it came to milking time they found not a drop
of milk. The girls, who went out to milk the cows, came back with empty
cans, saying: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;The milk has gone up into the cows&rsquo;
horns!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Colcheragh began to think that some one had put an evil
eye on his cows, so he swept up some of the dust from the cross
four-roads close by, in a shovel, and sprinkled it on their backs. But
the cows got no better. Then he wondered if some one was coming at
night to steal the milk. He made up his mind to sit in the cow-house
all night to see if he could catch the thief.</p>
<p class="par">So one night after everyone had gone to bed he crept out
of the house and hid himself under some straw in a corner of the
cow-house. Hour after hour of the dark lonesome night crept on, and he
heard nothing but the cows&rsquo; breathing and their rustle in the
straw. He was very cold and stiff, and he had just made up his mind to
go into the house, when a glimmering light showed under the door; and
then he heard Things laughing and talking&mdash;queer talk&mdash;he
knew that they were not right people. The cow-house door opened and in
came a whole lot of Little Men, dressed in green <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>coats
and leather caps. Keeking through the straw, he saw their horns hung by
their sides, their whips in their hands, and scores of little dogs of
every colour&mdash;green, blue, yellow, scarlet, and every colour you
can think of&mdash;at their heels. The cows were lying down. The Little
Fellows loosed the yokes from the cows&rsquo; necks, hopped on their
backs, a dozen, maybe, on each cow, and cracked their little whips. The
cows jumped to their feet and Themselves galloped off!</p>
<p class="par">Colcheragh ran to the stable, got on a horse, and made
chase after his cows. The night was dark, but he could hear the whizz
of the little whips through the air, the click of the cows&rsquo; hoofs
on stones, and the little dogs going:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Yep, yep, yep!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">He heard, too, the laughing of Themselves. Then one of
them would be singing out to the dogs, calling them up by name, giving
a call out of him:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Ho la, ho la, la!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Colcheragh followed these sounds, keeping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>close at
their heels. On and on they went, helter-skelter over hedges and over
ditches till they got to the Fairy Hill, and Colcheragh was still
following them, though on any other night he would not have gone within
a mile of the great green mound. When the Little Fellows came to the
hill they sounded a tan-ta-ra-ra-tan on their horns. The hill opened,
bright light streamed out, and sounds of music and great merriment.
Themselves passed through, and Colcheragh slid off his horse and
slipped unnoticed in after them. The hill closed behind them and he
found himself in a fine room, lit up till it was brighter than the
summer noonday. The whole place was crowded with Little People, young
and old, men and women, all decked out for a ball, that grand&mdash;he
had never looked on the like. Among them were some faces that he
thought he had seen before, but he took no notice of them, nor they of
him. In one part there was dancing to the music of Hom Mooar&mdash;that
was the name of the fiddler&mdash;and when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>he
played all men must follow him whether they would or no. The dancing
was like the dancing of flowers in the wind, such dancing as he had
never seen before.</p>
<p class="par">In another part his cows were being killed and roasted,
and after the dance there was a great feast, with scores of tables set
out with silver and gold and everything of the best to eat and drink.
There was roast and boiled, and sollaghan and cowree, and puddings and
pies, and jough and wine&mdash;a feast fit for the Governor himself.
When they were taking their seats one of them, whose face he thought he
knew, whispered to him: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t thee taste nothin&rsquo;
here or thou will be like me, and never go back to thy ones no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Colcheragh made up his mind to take this advice. When
the feast was coming to an end there was a shout for the
Jough-y-dorrys, the Stirrup Cup. Some one ran to fetch the cup. The one
among the Little People, who seemed to be their king, filled it with
red wine, drank himself, and passed it on to the rest. It was going
round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>from one to another until it came to Colcheragh,
who saw, when he had it in his hands, that it was of fine carved
silver, and more beautiful than anything ever seen outside that place.
He said to himself: &lsquo;The little durts have stolen and killed and
eaten my cattle&mdash;this cup, if it were mine, would pay me for
all.&rsquo; So standing up and grasping the silver cup tightly in his
hand, he held it up and said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Shoh Slaynt!&rsquo; which is the Manx toast.</p>
<p class="par">Then he dashed the cupful of wine over Themselves and
the lights. In an instant the place was in black darkness, save for a
stime of grey dawn light which came through the chink of the
half-closed door. Colcheragh made for it, cup in hand, slammed the door
behind him, and ran for his life.</p>
<p class="par">After a moment of uproar Themselves missed the cup and
Colcheragh, and with yells of rage they poured out of the hill after
him, in full chase. The farmer, who had a good start, ran as he had
never run before. He knew he would get small mercy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>at their
hands if he was caught; he went splashing through the wet mire and
keeping off the stepping stones; he knew they could not take him in the
water. He looked over his shoulder and caught a glimpse of the whole
Mob Beg behind him, close at his heels, waving their naked arms in the
light of the torch each one held up. On they came, shrieking and
howling in Manx:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Colcheragh, Colcheragh,</p>
<p class="line">Put thy foot on the stone,</p>
<p class="line">And do not put it in the wet!</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">But he ran in the water till he came to the
churchyard, and they could not touch him there. When he went into the
cowhouse the next morning the cows had all come home and they got rest
after that.</p>
<p class="par">He put the cup in the Church at Rushen, and they are
saying it was there for many years; then it was sent to London. It is
said that after this the farmer would not go out of his house of an
evening after dark. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"

<h2 class="main">THE CHILD WITHOUT A NAME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was many and many a year ago that the heiress
of Eary Cushlin Farm had a little child. Eary Cushlin is a terribly
lonely place; it stands high up on the Eanin Mooar, the big precipice,
close by the steep brow of Cronk-yn-Irree-Laa. You might live there for
months without seeing the face of clay, and no person knew of the birth
of the child. It was not welcome when it came, and as soon as it was
born, it died. Then the mother carried it, at dead of night, along the
narrow path over the rocks, past where the waters of Gob-yn-Ushtey leap
into the bay, past Ooig-ny-Goayr, the Cave of the Goat, to
Lag-ny-Keilley. She buried it in the ruins of the lonely little Keeill
that has been there on the hill-side for fourteen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>hundred
years and more. There she left it alone.</p>
<p class="par">A short while after some yawls were going to the haddock
fishing from Dalby. There was the &lsquo;Lucky Granny&rsquo; from the
Lagg, the Muck Beg, or Little Pig, from Cubbon Aalish&rsquo;s,
Boid-y-Conney from Cleary&rsquo;s, Glen Rushen, and others, ten in all.
Then it began to be said that something strange was going on over at
Lag-ny-Keilley. The men would be fishing close in to land under the
black shadow of Cronk-yn-Irree-Laa, the Hill of the Rising Day. When
little evening came, the yawls would be drifting south with the flood
tide, north with the ebb, passing and repassing the strand of
Lag-ny-Keilley. Then they would see a beautiful light and hear a
lamentation and crying, as if from a little lost child. In the end the
light would run up the steep brow to the old Keeill, and go out. The
men got so frightened that at last they would not go on the bay after
dark, but would make from the fishing-ground as soon as the sun was
getting low. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Things became so black for the women and children at
home that one old, old man, Illiam Quirk, who had not gone to sea for
many years, said he would go with one of the yawls to see for himself.
They used to say of him: &lsquo;Oul Illiam has the power at him in the
prayer, and he is a middlin&rsquo; despard fella; he will dar&rsquo;
most anything.&rsquo; It was so at this time&mdash;his yawl was the
last of them coming in; the rest were frightened. It was a right fine,
beautiful moonlight night when he was coming down from the mark, and
when he was near to Gob-yn-Ushtey he heard crying and crying. He lay on
his oars and listened, and he heard a little child wailing over and
over again: &lsquo;She lhiannoo beg dyn ennym mee!&rsquo; That is,
&lsquo;I am a little child without a name!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Pull nearer to the lan&rsquo;,&rsquo; said Illiam
when he heard it. They pulled close in, and he plainly saw a little
child on the strand bearing a lighted candle in his hand.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;God bless me, bogh, we mus&rsquo; give thee a
name!&rsquo; said Illiam. And he took <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>off his hat, and stood up
in the boat, and threw a handful of water towards the child, crying
out: &lsquo;If thou are a boy, I chrizzen thee in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Juan! If thou are a girl I chrizzen thee
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Joanney!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">In an instant the crying stopped, and was never heard
again, and the light went out and was seen no more. <span class=

the Little Ones got on well together too, but somehow or other he was
never able to get the power over them. People said he was never able to
learn their language right. Anyhow, be that as it may, he was often
enough with them.</p>
<p class="par">After the tailor had had a crack with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>the
women he turned round to Ballawhane, who was sitting in the big chair,
his elbow on the table and his hand holding his forehead, the other
hand in his trouser&rsquo;s pocket to the elbow, and he not minding
anybody nor anything.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I batter take yer measure, Mr. Teare, while yer
in, for there&rsquo;s no knowin&rsquo; how long that&rsquo;ll
be,&rsquo; the tailor said.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, boy, boy,&rsquo; answered Chalse, looking out
through the window&mdash;people were not bothering with blinds
then&mdash;and then turning to the clock, he said: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
no time goin&rsquo; to-night: I want to go from home apiece, an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s time I was <span class="corr" id="xd21e888" title=
"Source: gettin">gettin&rsquo;</span> ready.&rsquo; Nobody said a word
for a minute or two. He was exactly like a body with his mind far away.
Again, all of a sudden, he looked at the tailor. Then he said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Ahm goin&rsquo; to a big supper to-night.
Thou&rsquo;ll get nothin&rsquo; done here, maybe thou would like to go?
It&rsquo;s apiece to go, but thou&rsquo;ll be right enough with me. But
there&rsquo;s one promise I&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; from
thee&mdash;no matter, no matter what thou&rsquo;ll <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>see, nor
what thou&rsquo;ll hear, nor who&rsquo;ll spake to thee, thou
mustn&rsquo;t spake back or it&rsquo;ll be all over with
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">The tailor was so taken up with the chance of seeing the
Little People for himself that he promised faithfully, no matter what
took place, never to speak a word, and he knew he would be right enough
with Chalse.</p>
<p class="par">Ballawhane then took his hat from the <i>latt</i>, and
when he was going out he said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be back for thee just now; side thee
things a bit while thou &rsquo;re waitin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">In a while there was a noise of horses coming up the
street&mdash;it was awful. Then they stopped on the street and in came
Ballawhane saying:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;We couldn&rsquo; get another hoss for thee, boy,
do what we would, but thou &rsquo;ll have to get a hoss of some
sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And going down to the parlour he got hold of something,
and went out, never saying a word. Coming back to the door after a bit,
he said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Come on, boy. I&rsquo;ll hold her head till thou
get on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Out goes the tailor, and up, with one whip, on her back,
and they go like the very hommers, on and on, over hedges and ditches,
till they came to a big brow by a river. It seems they knew the way,
night as it was, for they all took it one after another like fun. It
was a big jump, though, and when the tailor felt himself flying through
the air, his heart jumped to his mouth.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Oh Lord, what a jump!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">The next minute he fell flop in a bog, with the lapboard
between his legs, all alone in the dark. Next morning he got up all
slaaed with slush, looking like a thing that had been dragged through a
gutter, and as quiet as a mouse&mdash;the shy he was, every bit of
steam took out of him.</p>
<p class="par">Awhile after some of the women were asking him, how did
he like it last night, and would he go again? But all they could get
out of him was:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, naver no more, naver no more!&rsquo;

<h2 class="main">JOE MOORE&rsquo;S STORY OF FINN MACCOOILLEY AND THE
BUGGANE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This Finn MacCooilley was an Irish giant, and the
Buggane was a Manx giant. But, anyway at all, this Finn came across
from the Mountains of Mourne to see what was the Isle of Mann like, for
he was seeing land. He liked the island uncommon well, so he stopped in
it, living out Cregneish way. The Buggane was hearing great talk about
the giant Finn MacCooilley that was in the Sound, so he came down from
the top of Barrule to put a sight on him. Finn knew that he was coming
to have a fight with him, to see who was best man, and Finn did not
want to fight. &lsquo;Lave him to me,&rsquo; says the wife;
&lsquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll put the augh-augh on him!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Before long they caught sight of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>Buggane,
and he was a walking terror. He was coming from Barrule to them, in a
mighty pursue.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Slip in the criddle, Finn,&rsquo; says she.
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;ll spake to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Up comes the Buggane to the door, hot-foot.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Himself?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;This man is gone from home this bit,&rsquo; says
she. &lsquo;What is it you are wantin&rsquo; with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, there is no hurry on me. I&rsquo;ll put my
fut inside and wait till he comes back,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Plaze yourself,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll plaze me; but I must get on with my
bakin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Who have you got in the criddle?&rsquo; says
he.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s our baby,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;An&rsquo; in the name of the Unknown Powers, what
sort of a man is he Himself if his baby is that big?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;He&rsquo;s very big an&rsquo; powerful,&rsquo;
says she. &lsquo;An&rsquo; the child is favourin&rsquo; the
father.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She was baking barley bread, and when the baking was
done at her, she took the griddle and put it between two cakes of
bread, and gave it to the Buggane to eat, with a quart of buttermilk.
He went to try and eat, and he couldn&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, man-alive! But this is the hard bread,&rsquo;
says he. &lsquo;What sort have you given me at all, at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the sort I&rsquo;m giving
Finn,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;An&rsquo; will Finn&rsquo;s teeth go through
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, yes, Finn thought nothing at all of
&rsquo;atin&rsquo; that&mdash;that&rsquo;s the sort of bread he was
wantin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says Thrinn.</p>
<p class="par">Finn got up out of the cradle, and began to roar for a
piece. She fetched him a clout on the lug.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Stop your noisin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says she.
&lsquo;An&rsquo; stand straight and don&rsquo;t be puttin&rsquo; the
drone on yer back like that.&rsquo; And givin&rsquo; him a buttercake,
she says:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Ate, ate, lash into ye, an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s
have no lavins.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have the chile&rsquo;s teeth broke
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>his head, woman. He can naver ate bread as hard as
that!&rsquo; says the Buggane.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, he can do that with life,&rsquo; says
she.</p>
<p class="par">But that done the Buggane; he sleeched out and claned
away again. He thought if Finn was that strong and the baby that big,
he had best catch home again.</p>
<p class="par">But it was not long until the Buggane and Finn did meet,
and then they had the battle! One day Finn met the Buggane over at Kirk
Christ Rushen, and they went at each other early in the day till the
sunset. Finn had one fut in the Big Sound, an&rsquo; so he made the
Channel between the Calf and Kitterland, and the other in the Little
Sound, an&rsquo; so he made the narrow Channel between Kitterland and
the islan&rsquo;. The Buggane was standin&rsquo; at Port
Iern&mdash;that&rsquo;s what made the fine big openin&rsquo; at Port
Iern. The rocks were all broken to pieces with their feet. But, anyway,
the Buggane came off victorious and slashed Finn awful, so he had to
run to Ireland. Finn could walk on the sea, but the Buggane
couldn&rsquo;; and when Finn got off and he couldn&rsquo; get
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>more revenge on him, he tore out a tooth and hove
it whizzing through the air after Finn. It hit him on the back of the
head, and then it fell into the sea and became what we are now calling
the Chickens&rsquo; Rock. Finn turned round with a roar and a mighty
curse:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;My seven swearings of a curse on it!&rsquo; says
he. &lsquo;Let it lie there for a vexation to the sons of men while
water runs and grass grows!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And a vexation and a curse has it been to seamen from
that day to this. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"

<h2 class="main">THE FYNODEREE OF GORDON</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There was one time a Fynoderee living in Gordon.
Those persons who saw him said that he was big and shaggy, with fiery
eyes, and stronger than any man. One night he met the blacksmith who
was going home from his shop and held out his hand to him to shake
hands. The blacksmith gave him hold of the iron sock of the plough
which he had with him, and he squeezed it as if it had been a piece of
clay, saying: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some strong Manx-men in the world
yet!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Fynoderee did all his work at night and went into
hidlans in the daytime. One night, when he was out on his travels he
came to Mullin Sayle, out in Glen Garragh. He saw a light in the mill,
so he put his head through the open top-half of the door <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>to see
what was going on inside, and there was Quaye Mooar&rsquo;s wife
sifting corn. When she caught sight of the great big head she was
frightened terrible. She had presence of mind, however, to hand him the
sieve and say: &lsquo;If thou go to the river and bring water in it,
I&rsquo;ll make a cake for thee; and the more water thou carry back,
that&rsquo;s the bigger thy cake will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the Fynoderee took the sieve, and ran down to the
river; but the water poured from it and he could fetch none for the
cake, and he threw the sieve away in a rage, and cried:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="gv" class="lg">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Dollan, dollan, dash!</p>
<p class="line">Ny smoo ta mee cur ayn,</p>
<p class="line">Ny smoo ta goll ass.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Sieve, sieve, dash!</p>
<p class="line">The more I put in,</p>
<p class="line">The more there&rsquo;s going out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">The woman got away while he was trying to fill the
sieve, and when he came back to the mill he found it in darkness.</p>
<p class="par">The Fynoderee was working very hard for the Radcliffes,
who owned Gordon then. Every night he was grinding their corn for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>them, and often he would take a hand at the
flails. If they put a stack into the barn in the evening and loosed
every sheaf of it, they would find it thrashed in the morning, but he
would not touch one sheaf of it unless it were loosed. In the summer
time he was getting in their hay and cutting their corn.</p>
<p class="par">Many a time the people of the farm were passing the time
of day with him. One cold frosty day, big Gordon was docking turnips
and he blew on his fingers to warm them.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What are thou blowing on thee fingers for?&rsquo;
said the Fynoderee.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;To put them in heat,&rsquo; said the Farmer.</p>
<p class="par">At supper that night the Farmer&rsquo;s porridge was hot
and he blew on it.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What are thou doing that for?&rsquo; said the
Fynoderee. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it hot enough for thee?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too hot, it is; I&rsquo;m blowing on
it to cool it,&rsquo; said the Farmer.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like thee at all, boy,&rsquo; said
the Fynoderee, &lsquo;for thou can blow hot and blow cold with one
breath.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Fynoderee was wearing no clothes, but it is said
that he never felt the cold. Big Gordon, however, had pity on him that
he had none, and one frosty winter he went and got clothes made for
him&mdash;breeches, jacket, waistcoat and cap&mdash;great big ones they
were too. And he went and gave them to him in the barn one night. The
Fynoderee looked on them and took them up, and says he:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Coat for the back is sickness for the back!</p>
<p class="line">Vest for the middle is bad for the middle!</p>
<p class="line">Breeches for the breech is a curse for the breech!</p>
<p class="line">Cap for the head is injurious for the head!</p>
<p class="line">If thou own big Gordon farm, boy&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">If thine this little glen east, and thine this little
glen west,</p>
<p class="line">Not thine the merry Glen of Rushen yet, boy!</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">So he flung the clothes away and walked his ways
to Glen Rushen, out to Juan Mooar Cleary&rsquo;s. He was working for
him then, cutting the meadow hay for him, cutting turf for him, and
seeing after the sheep.</p>
<p class="par">It happened one winter&rsquo;s night that there was a
great snow-storm. Juan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52"
name="pb52">52</a>]</span>Mooar got up to see after the sheep, but the
Fynoderee came to the window.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Lie, lie an&rsquo; take a sleep, Juan,&rsquo;
says he; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got all the sheep in the fold, but there was
one loaghtan (brown native sheep) yearling there that give me more
trouble till all the res&rsquo;. My seven curses on the little
loaghtan! I was twice round Barrule Mooar afther her, but I caught her
for all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Juan went out in the morning all the sheep were
safe in the cogee house and a big hare in with them, with two short
lankets on him, that was the brown yearling!</p>
<p class="par">After a time the Fynoderee went up to the top of Barrule
Mountain to live, up to the very peak. Himself and the wife went to
make a potful of porridge one day, and they fell out.</p>
<p class="par">She ran and left him. He threw a big white rock after
her and it struck her on the heel&mdash;the mark of the blood is still
on the stone at Cleigh Fainey. While she stooped to put a rag on her
heel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>he threw a lot of small rocks at her, that made
her give a spring to the Lagg, two miles away. Then he threw a big rock
with the pot-stick in it&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the Lagg river to-day. At
that she gave two leaps over the sea to the Mountains of Mourne in
Ireland; and for all that I know she&rsquo;s living there still.

<h2 class="main">BILLY BEG, TOM BEG, AND THE FAIRIES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Not far from Dalby, Billy Beg and Tom Beg, two
humpback cobblers, lived together on a lonely croft. Billy Beg was
sharper and cleverer than Tom Beg, who was always at his command. One
day Billy Beg gave Tom a staff, and quoth he:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Tom Beg, go to the mountain and fetch home the
white sheep.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tom Beg took the staff and went to the mountain, but he
could not find the white sheep. At last, when he was far from home and
dusk was coming on, he began to think that he had best go back. The
night was fine, and stars and a small crescent moon were in the sky. No
sound was to be heard but the curlew&rsquo;s sharp whistle. Tom was
hastening home, and had almost reached <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>Glen Rushen, when a grey
mist gathered and he lost his way. But it was not long before the mist
cleared, and Tom Beg found himself in a green glen such as he had never
seen before, though he thought he knew every glen within five miles of
him, for he was born and reared in the neighbourhood. He was marvelling
and wondering where he could be, when he heard a far-away sound drawing
nearer to him.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw,&rsquo; said he to himself,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s more than myself afoot on the mountains to-night;
I&rsquo;ll have company.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">The sound grew louder. First, it was like the humming of
bees, then like the rushing of Glen Meay waterfall, and last it was
like the marching and the murmur of a crowd. It was the fairy host. Of
a sudden the glen was full of fine horses and of Little People riding
on them, with the lights on their red caps, shining like the stars
above, and making the night as bright as day. There was the blowing of
horns, the waving of flags, the playing of music, and the barking of
many little dogs. Tom Beg <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>thought that he had never seen
anything so splendid as all he saw there. In the midst of the drilling
and dancing and singing one of them spied Tom, and then Tom saw coming
towards him the grandest Little Man he had ever set eyes upon, dressed
in gold and silver, and silk shining like a raven&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;It is a bad time you have chosen to come this
way,&rsquo; said the Little Man, who was the king.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Yes; but it is not here that I&rsquo;m wishing to
be though,&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p class="par">Then said the king: &lsquo;Are you one of us to-night,
Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I am surely,&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;it will be
your duty to take the password. You must stand at the foot of the glen,
and as each regiment goes by, you must take the password: it is Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do that with a heart and a
half,&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p class="par">At daybreak the fiddlers took up their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>fiddles,
the Fairy army set itself in order, the fiddlers played before them out
of the glen, and sweet that music was. Each regiment gave the password
to Tom as it went by&mdash;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday; and last of all came the king, and he, too, gave
it&mdash;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Then
he called in Manx to one of his men:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Take the hump from this fellow&rsquo;s
back,&rsquo; and before the words were out of his mouth the hump was
whisked off Tom Beg&rsquo;s back and thrown into the hedge. How proud
now was Tom, who so found himself the straightest man in the Isle of
Mann! He went down the mountain and came home early in the morning with
light heart and eager step. Billy Beg wondered greatly when he saw Tom
Beg so straight and strong, and when Tom Beg had rested and refreshed
himself he told his story: how he had met the Fairies who came every
night to Glen Rushen to drill.</p>
<p class="par">The next night Billy Beg set off along <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>the
mountain road and came at last to the green glen. About midnight he
heard the trampling of horses, the lashing of whips, the barking of
dogs, and a great hullabaloo, and, behold, the Fairies and their king,
their dogs and their horses, all at drill in the glen as Tom Beg had
said.</p>
<p class="par">When they saw the humpback they all stopped, and one
came forward and very crossly asked his business.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I am one of Yourselves for the night, and should
be glad to do you some service,&rsquo; said Billy Beg.</p>
<p class="par">So he was set to take the password&mdash;Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. And at daybreak the
King said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time for us to be off,&rsquo; and up came
regiment after regiment giving Billy Beg the password&mdash;Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Last of all came the
king with his men, and gave the password also&mdash;Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, &lsquo;<span class="sc">and
Sunday</span>,&rsquo; says Billy Beg, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>thinking himself clever.
Then there was a great outcry.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Get the hump that was taken off that
fellow&rsquo;s back last night and put it on this man&rsquo;s
back,&rsquo; said the King, with flashing eyes, pointing to the hump
that lay under the hedge.</p>
<p class="par">Before the words were well out of his mouth the hump was
clapt on to Billy Beg&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;be off, and if
ever I find you here again, I will clap another hump on to your
front!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And on that they all marched away with one great shout,
and left poor Billy Beg standing where they had found him, with a hump
growing on each shoulder. And he came home next day dragging one foot
after another, with a wizened face and as cross as two sticks, with his
two humps on his back, and if they are not off they are there still.

<h2 class="main">THE LAZY WIFE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Well, there was a woman once, and she was
scandalous lazy. She was that lazy she would do nothing but sit in the
corner of the <i>chiollagh</i> warming herself, or going on the houses
for newses the day long. And one day her man gives her some wool to
spin for him; he was terrible badly off for clothes to wear, for she
was letting them get all ragged on him. He had told her to mend them
until he was tired, but all he could get out of her was &lsquo;<i>Traa
dy liooar</i>.&rsquo; Time enough!</p>
<p class="par">One day he comes to her, and says:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Thou <i>liggey my hraa</i>, here is some wool for
thee to spin, and if it is not done a month from this day, I&rsquo;ll
throw thee out on the side of the road. Thou and thy <i>Traa dy
liooar</i> have left me nearly bare.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Well, she was too lazy to spin, but she would be
pretending to be working hard when the husband was in the house. She
used to put the wheel out on the floor every night before the husband
came in from work, to let on to him that she had been spinning.</p>
<p class="par">The husband was asking her was the thread getting near
spun, for he said he was seeing the wheel so often on the floor that he
wanted to know if she had enough to take to the weaver. When it came to
the last week but one, she had only one ball spun, and that one was
knotted and as coarse as gorse. When her husband says to her:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m seeing the wheel middling often on the
floor when I come home at night; maybe there&rsquo;s enough thread spun
at thee now for me to take to the weaver next week?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, at all,&rsquo; says the wife.
&lsquo;Maybe there is; let us count the balls.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then the play began! Up she went on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>the
<i>lout</i>, and flung the ball through the hole, down to him.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Keep count thyself, and fling the balls back
again to me,&rsquo; says she to the man. And as fast as he flung the
ball up to her, so fast she flung it down to him again. When he had
counted the ball, maybe, two score times, she says to him:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s in.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, &rsquo;deed, you&rsquo;ve spun well, woman,
for all,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s plenty done at thee for
the weaver.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aw, then she was in a great fix, and didn&rsquo;t know
in her senses what to do to save herself. She knew she would sup sorrow
if she was found out, but she could think of nothing.</p>
<p class="par">At last she bethought herself of the Giant that lived in
a lonesome place up the mountain, for she had heard tell he was good to
work, and the woman, she says to herself:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to go my ways to him.&rsquo;
She took the road early next morning, she and her rolls of wool, and
she walked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>up hills, down gills, till at last she came to the
Giant&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What are thou wanting here?&rsquo; says the
Giant.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m wanting thee to help me,&rsquo; says
she; and she up and told him about the ball of thread and
everything.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll spin the wool for thee,&rsquo; says
the Giant, &lsquo;if thou&rsquo;ll tell me my name when thou come for
the balls a week from this day. Are thou satisfied?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be satisfied?&rsquo; says
the woman; for she thought to herself it would be a middling queer
thing if she couldn&rsquo;t find out his name within a week. Well, the
woman she tried every way to find out the Giant&rsquo;s name, but, go
where she might, no one had ever heard tell of it. The time was getting
over fast, and she was no nearer to the Giant&rsquo;s name. At last it
came to the last day but one.</p>
<p class="par">Now, as it happened, the husband was coming home from
the mountain that day in the little evening, and as he neared the
Giant&rsquo;s house, he saw it all in a blaze of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>light,
and there was a great whirling and whistling coming to his ears, and
along with it came singing, and laughing, and shouting. So he drew near
the window, and then he sees the big Giant inside sitting at a wheel,
spinning like the wind, and his hands flying with the thread to and
fro, to and fro, like the lightning, and he shouting to the whistling
wheel: &lsquo;Spin, wheel, spin faster; and sing, wheel, sing
louder!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And he sings, as the wheel whirls faster and faster:</p>

<p class="line">That my name is Mollyndroat!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">When the husband got home that evening he was
late, and his wife said to him:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Where have you been so late? Did thou hear
anything new?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Then he said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Thou are middling good to spin thyself, <i>ven
thie</i>; but I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;s one in that&rsquo;s
better than thee, for all. Never in all my born days did I see such
spinning, a thread as fine as a cobweb, and hear such singing as there
was going on in the Giant&rsquo;s house to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What was he singing?&rsquo; says the wife. And he
sang the song to her:</p>
<div lang="gv" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Snieu, queeyl, snieu; &rsquo;rane, queeyl,

<p class="par first">Well, well, the joy the woman took when she heard
the song!</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, what sweet music! Sing it again, my good
man,&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p class="par">And he sang it to her again, till she knew it by
heart.</p>
<p class="par">Early next morning, she went as fast as her feet could
carry her to the Giant&rsquo;s house. The road was long, and a bit
lonesome under the trees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href=

<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come again for the thread,&rsquo; says
she.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aisy, aisy, good woman,&rsquo; says the Giant.
&lsquo;If thou don&rsquo;t tell me my name thou won&rsquo;t get the

<h2 class="main">THE MERMAID OF GOB NY OOYL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Once on a time there lived at the bottom end of
Cornah gill a family of the name of Sayle, and the Mermaid who had her
haunt up Bulgham way was a friend to them. They were always in
luck&rsquo;s way and never seemed to be short of anything. Sure enough
they were full of thrift, and to fill in odds of spare time they made
lobster pots from the osier that grew around in plenty, and they always
found a ready market. They kept a cow and a few sheep, just to give
work to the women in the long winter nights, but their living was
mostly got by the sea.</p>
<p class="par">It was well known that Sayle had a strong liking for
apples, and that he would often bring some with him out in the boat,
but when he got well up in years he would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>be leaving a lot of the
boat-work for the boys, and then the luck began to get less, and many a
time one of them had to take a gun to keep something in the pot. Then
the bigger ones took to the herrings. One, Evan, however, had to stay
about to keep things going, and it happened that one day, after he had
the creels set, just at Bulgham, that he pulled the boat in and went up
the brow after eggs. On coming back to the boat he heard some one
calling to him, and, looking round, he saw a fine-looking woman sitting
on the edge of a rock.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;And how&rsquo;s your father?&rsquo; said she.
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s seldom he&rsquo;s coming this way now.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Young Sayle was a bit frightened at first, but seeing a
pleasant look on her face, he took courage and told her how things were
at home. Then, saying she hoped to see him again, she slipped into the
water and disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">On getting home he told what had taken place, and the
father, his face lighting up, declared:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;There will be luck on the house yet.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">And he said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Take some apples with you the next time you go up
that way, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">The very next time the young chap went, he took some
apples with him, and when he got to the place where he had seen the
beautiful woman, he went, as usual, on the hunt among the rocks. Then
he heard sweet singing, and when he turned round what should he see but
the Mermaid leaning over the boat and smiling pleasantly. She took an
apple and began to eat and chant:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The luck o&rsquo; the sea be with you, but don&rsquo;t
forgetful be</p>
<p class="line">Of bringing some sweet lan&rsquo; eggs for the children
of the sea.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">From that time he was nearly living on the water
until, at last, he was taken to task for being idle. Then he made up
his mind to go sailing in foreign parts. The Mermaid was in great
distress, so to please her, he went and planted an apple tree on the
brow above her haunt, telling her that when he would be far away this
tree <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>would grow land-eggs which, when they would be
sweet and ready for eating, would come of themselves to the water for
her. And, sure enough, the luck of the family remained, though the boy
was gone.</p>
<p class="par">She seemed to bear up well for a long time and would
often be seen sitting on the rocks in the evening, singing sad songs,
and casting longing glances up to the apple tree above. She kept very
shy of everyone coming her way, and at last, finding the apples slow in
coming, made up her mind to go in search of young Sayle, hoping the
apples would be ready for taking when they would come back.</p>
<p class="par">But neither of them ever came back, though for many a
long year the apple tree bore fruit and marked the little creek where
the Mermaid used to live. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One time the Farmer of Ballaleece married a
beautiful young wife and they were thinking the world of one another.
But before long she disappeared. Some persons said that she was dead
and others that she was taken by the Little People. Ballaleece mourned
for her with a heavy heart and looked for her from Point of Ayr to the
Calf; but in the end, not finding her, he married another wife. This
one was not beautiful, but there was some money at her.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after the marriage his first wife appeared to
Ballaleece one night, and said to him:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;My man, my man, I was taken away by the Little
People, and I live with them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=

will but do what I tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Tell me quick,&rsquo; said Ballaleece.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be riding through Ballaleece barn at
midnight on Friday,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be going in on
one door and out on another. I&rsquo;ll be riding behind one of the men
on horseback. You&rsquo;ll sweep the barn clean, and mind there is not
one straw left on the floor. Catch hold of my bridle rein, hold it
fast, and I shall be free.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">When the night came Ballaleece took a besom and swept
the barn floor so clean that not one speck was left on it. Then he
waited in the dark.</p>
<p class="par">At midnight the barn doors opened wide, sweet music was
heard, and in through the open door came a fine company of Little
People, in green jackets and red caps, riding fine horses. On the last
horse, sitting behind a Little Fellow, Ballaleece saw his first wife as
pretty as a picture, and as young as when she left him. He seized hold
of her bridle rein, but he was shaken from side to side like a leaf on
a tree, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>he was not able to hold her. As she went out
through the door she stretched out her right hand and pointed to a
bushel in the corner of the barn, and called out in a sad voice:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;There&rsquo;s been a straw put under the
bushel&mdash;for that reason you couldn&rsquo;t hold me, and
you&rsquo;ve done with me for ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">The second wife had heard what had passed and had hidden
the straw, and turned the bushel upside down so that it would not be
seen.</p>
<p class="par">The young wife was never heard of any more. <span class=

the house of the giant; they went in the house and the giant was from
home. So the horse went under the big table, and the bull went under
the dresser, and the goat went on the stairs, and all the rest in the
corners.</p>
<p class="par">When the giant came home, they all <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is a deep dub, or pool, on Ballacoan stream,
which the children of Laxey call Nikkesen&rsquo;s. It is the home of
Nyker, the Water Goblin. It has no bottom; and brambles and ferns are
growing round it, and fir trees and hazels are hiding it from sight. No
child, no grown-up person even, will go near it after dark.</p>
<p class="par">A great many years ago a beautiful girl living at
Ballaquine was sent to look for the calves, which had gone astray. She
had got as far as Nikkesen&rsquo;s, when she took a notion that she
heard the calves over the river in Johnny Baldoon&rsquo;s nuts. At once
she began to call to them:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Kebeg! Kebeg! Kebeg!&rsquo; so loud that you
could hear her at Chibber Pherick, Patrick&rsquo;s Well. The people
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>could hear her calling quite plainly, but, behold,
a great mist came and rolled down the valley, and shut it from sight.
The people on one side of the valley could hear her voice yet calling
through the mist:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Kebeg! Kebeg! Kebeg!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then came a little sweet voice through the mist and the
trees in answer:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Kebeg&rsquo;s here! Kebeg&rsquo;s
here!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And she cried:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;m
comin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And that was all.</p>
<p class="par">The Fairies who live in Nikkesen&rsquo;s had pulled her
in, and carried her to their own home.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE FAIRY CHILD OF CLOSE NY LHEIY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One time there was a woman named Colloo, in Close
ny Lheiy, near Glen Meay, and she had a child that had fallen sick in a
strange way. Nothing seemed wrong with him, yet crosser and crosser he
grew, <i>nying nyanging</i> night and day. The woman was in great
distress. Charms had failed, and she didn&rsquo;t know rightly what to
do.</p>
<p class="par">It seems that when about a fortnight old, the child, as
fine a child for his age as you would see in a day&rsquo;s walk, was
left asleep while the mother went to the well for water. Now Herself
forgot to put the tongs on the cradle, and when she came back the child
was crying pitifully, and there was no quieting for him. And from that
very hour the flesh seemed to melt off his bones till he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>became
as ugly and as wizened a child as you would see between the Point of
Ayr and the Calf. He was that way, his whining howl filling the house,
for four years, lying in his cradle without a motion on him to put his
feet under him. Not a day&rsquo;s rest nor a night&rsquo;s sleep had
the woman these four years with him. She was fairly scourged until
there came a fine day in the spring, while Hom Beg Bridson, the tailor,
was in the house sewing. Hom is dead now, but there&rsquo;s many alive
that remember him yet. He was wise tremendous, for he was going from
house to house sewing, and gathering wisdom as he was going.</p>
<p class="par">Well, before that day the tailor was seeing lots of
wickedness in the child. When the woman would be out feeding the cows
and pigs, he would be hoisting his head up out of the cradle and making
faces at the tailor, winking and slicking, and shaking his head, and
saying &lsquo;What a lad I am!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">That day the woman wanted to go to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>the shop
to sell some eggs that she had, and says she to the tailor: &lsquo;Hom,
man, keep your eye on the chile that the bogh won&rsquo;t fall out of
the criddle an&rsquo; hurt himself, while I slip down to the
shop.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">When she was gone the tailor began to whistle, low and
slow, to himself, as he stitched, the tune of a little hymn.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Drop that, Hom Beg,&rsquo; said a little harsh
voice.</p>
<p class="par">The tailor, scandalised, looked round to see if it was
the child that had spoken, and it was.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Whush, whush, now; lie quate,&rsquo; said the
tailor, rocking the cradle with his foot, and as he rocked he whistled
the hymn tune louder.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Drop that, Hom Beg, I tell ye, an&rsquo; give us
something light an&rsquo; handy,&rsquo; said the little fella back to
him, middling sharp.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, anything at all to plaze thee,&rsquo; said
the tailor, whistling a jig.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Hom,&rsquo; said my lad, &lsquo;can thou dance
anything to that?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I can,&rsquo; said the tailor. &lsquo;Can
thou?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I can that,&rsquo; said my lad. &lsquo;Would thou
like to see me dance?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I would,&rsquo; said the tailor.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Take that oul&rsquo; fiddle down, then, Hom,
man,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;an&rsquo; put &ldquo;The tune of the Big
Wheel&rdquo; on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, I&rsquo;ll do that for thee, an&rsquo;
welcome,&rsquo; said the tailor.</p>
<p class="par">The fiddle quits its hook on the wall, and the tailor
tunes up.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Hom,&rsquo; said the little fella, &lsquo;before
thou begin to play, clear the kitchen for me&mdash;cheers an&rsquo;
stools, everything away&mdash;make a place for me to step out to the
music, man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, I&rsquo;ll do that for thee, too,&rsquo; said
the tailor. He cleared the kitchen floor, and then he struck up
&lsquo;Tune y wheeyl vooar.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">In a crack the little fella bounced from his cradle on
to the floor with a &lsquo;Chu!&rsquo; and began flying round the
kitchen.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Go it, Hom&mdash;face your partner&mdash;heel
an&rsquo; toe does it. Well done, Hom&mdash;more power to your elba,
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Hom plays faster and faster, till my lad <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>was
jumping as high as the table. With a &lsquo;Chu!&rsquo; up goes his
foot on top of the dresser, and &lsquo;Chu!&rsquo; then on top of the
chimney piece, and &lsquo;Chu!&rsquo; bang against the partition; then
he was half flying, half footing it round the kitchen, turning and
going that quick that it put a reel in Hom&rsquo;s head to be looking
at him. Then he was whirling everything round for a clear space, even
Hom himself, who by degrees gets up on the table in the corner, and
plays wilder and faster, as the whirling jig grows madder and
swifter.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;M&rsquo;Yee!&rsquo; said the tailor, throwing
down the fiddle. &lsquo;I mus&rsquo; run, thou&rsquo;re not the chile
that was in the criddle! Are thou?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Houl&rsquo; man! thou&rsquo;re right
enough,&rsquo; said the little fella. &lsquo;Strike up for
me&mdash;make has&rsquo;e, make has&rsquo;e, man&mdash;keep
joggin&rsquo; your elba.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Whush!&rsquo; said the tailor,
&lsquo;here&rsquo;s Herself comin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">The dance suddenly ceased. The child gave a hop, skip,
and jump into the cradle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Go on with thy sewing, Hom; don&rsquo;t say a
word,&rsquo; said the little fella, covering himself up in the clothes
till nothing was left of him to be seen except his eyes, which keeked
out like a ferret&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">When Herself came in the house, the tailor, all of a
tremble, was sitting cross-legged on the round table and his
spec&rsquo;s on his nose and letting on that he was busy sewing; the
child in the cradle was grinning and crying as usual.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What in all the earthly worl&rsquo;
&mdash;&mdash;! But it&rsquo;s the quare stitching, altogether,
there&rsquo;s been goin&rsquo; on here, an&rsquo; me out. An&rsquo; how
thou can see the needle in that dark corner, Hom Bridson, let alone
sew, it bates me,&rsquo; said she, siding the place. &lsquo;Well,
well&mdash;then, well, well&mdash;on the boghee millish. What is it at
all, at all, that&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; on the veen? Did he think Mammy
had gone an&rsquo; left him then, the chree? Mammy is goin&rsquo; to
feed him, though.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">The tailor had been thinking mighty with himself what he
ought to do, so he said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Look here, woman, give him nothing at all, but go
out an&rsquo; get a creelful of good turf an&rsquo; a whisp of
feern.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">She brought the turf, and throws a bundle of fern on
it.</p>
<p class="par">The tailor gave a leap off the table down to the floor,
and it wasn&rsquo;t long till he had the fine fire.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;ll have the house put on fire for me,
Hom,&rsquo; said Herself.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;No fear, but I&rsquo;ll fire some of them,&rsquo;
said the tailor. The child, with his two eyes going out of his head
watching to see what the tailor was going to do, was slowly turning his
whining howl into a kind of call&mdash;to his own sort to come and
fetch him, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send thee home,&rsquo; said the
tailor, drawing near the cradle, and he stretches out his two hands to
take the child and put him on the big, red turf fire.</p>
<p class="par">Before he was able to lay a hand on him, the little
fella leaped out of the cradle and took for the door.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;The back of me han&rsquo; an&rsquo; the sole of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>me fut to you!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if I would
only a-had another night I could have showed thee a trick or two more
than that yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then the door flew open with a bang, as though some one
had thrown it open, and he took off with himself like a shot. A
hullabaloo of laughing and making fun was heard outside, and the noise
of many running little feet. Out of the door of the house goes Herself,
and Hom after her; they see no one, but they caught sight of a flock of
low-lying clouds shaped like gulls chasing each other away up Glen
Rushen, and then came to their ears, as if afar off from the clouds,
sharp whistles and wicked little laughs as if making mock of them. Then
as they were turning round to come back, she suddenly sees right before
her, her own sweet, rosy, smiling child, with thumb in mouth, lying on
a mossy bank. And she took all the joy in the world of the child that
he was back again safe and sound. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"

<h2 class="main">THE LITTLE FOOTPRINTS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Close to the Niarbyl, the great tail of rock that
stretches into the sea at Dalby, is a little house on the strand. It is
sheltered behind by the high rock which rises above its thatched roof.
Before it lies Bay Mooar, the great bay, held by a chain of mountains
purple with ling. Standing before its door and looking to the west, you
may see the sun set behind the distant Mourne Mountains. At dawn you
may see him rise over Cronk-yn-Irree-Laa, the Hill of the Rising Day.
Here lived Juan, the fisherman.</p>
<p class="par">He knew, as well as any person, that the Little People
were all around. When he was a boy he had many a time looked out of the
door on moonlight nights to try if he could put sight on them dancing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>on the lonely shore. He had not seen
them&mdash;they make themselves invisible when they know that mortal
eyes are on them. But he had seen the tiny riding lights of their
herring fleet in the bay, and had helped his father to draw in the nets
full of good fish, which were sure to be caught the night after. Many a
time he had wakened from his sleep in the dark, and, in the pauses of
the wind and the lull of the great breakers, he had heard the sound of
hammering. He knew it was the Little People hammering at their herring
barrels in Ooig-ny-Seyir, the Coopers&rsquo; Cave, under the hills, and
that as the chips flew out on to the waves they became ships.</p>
<p class="par">He had heard the story of the fisherman, a friend of his
father&rsquo;s, who was fishing one night at Lag-ny-Keilley, when a
dense grey mist rolled in. He thought he had best make for home while
the footpath above the rocks was visible. When he was getting his
things together he heard what sounded like a lot of children coming out
of school. He lifted his head, and, behold, there was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>fleet of
fairy boats each side of the rock, their riding lights shining like
little stars on a frosty night. The crews seemed busy preparing to come
on shore, and he heard one little fellow shout:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Hraaghyn boght as earish broigh, skeddan dy
liooar ec yn mooinjer seihll shoh, cha nel veg ain!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Poor times and dirty weather, herring enough at the
people of this world, nothing at us!</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the fisherman, &lsquo;they
dropped off and went agate o&rsquo; the flitters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Juan was a big boy he himself saw a thing which he
never forgot. One day he left a boat over at the farther side of Bay
Mooar, and at night he had to go over to fetch it. It was a moonlight
night and the bay was as smooth as glass as he rowed across. There was
no sound but the lapping of the little waves on the shore, and now and
again the cry of a gannet. Juan found his boat on the strand where he
had left her and was setting to work to launch her, when he thought he
saw a glimmering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>light, which was not the light of the moon, in one
of the caves near him. He stood where he was, and listened, and he
heard the sound of faint music. Then he went as silently as he was able
to the cave, and looked in. No light was there but the dim light of the
moon. The shadows in the corners of the cave were as black as
pitch.</p>
<p class="par">Juan was trembling all over, and at first he was
blinking his eyes and could see nothing. But after some minutes he saw
a great stone in the midst of the cave and the floor of fine white
sand. And on the sand around that stone there were little
footprints&mdash;marks of tiny clogs they were, no bigger than his
thumb! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=

<h2 class="main">THE TALL MAN OF BALLACURRY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Tom Craine was going home at midnight from Bradda
mine to his home at Colby. The road was lonely and he met no person,
but the full moon was shining and it was as light as day. As he began
to pass under the trees that grow round the house at Ballacurry, a
little dog appeared suddenly from the black shadow at the roadside and
followed at his heels. He whistled to it, but as he turned his head to
look at it, it ran on in front of him, and for a minute he did not see
it. When he came in sight of it again, he was terrified to see that it
had grown larger&mdash;as big as a goat&mdash;and it grew bigger and
bigger till it was the size of a donkey! It galloped before him and
disappeared round the bend of the road where the gate of Ballacurry is.
When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>Tom came to the gate he saw a very tall, thin man
leaning on it, with his arms folded on the top of it. The beast was not
there. As Tom reached the gate the tall thin man turned and walked up
the long path that leads to the house. When he got to the door he
turned again and walked back down the path towards Tom. By the bright
moonlight Tom saw the lace ruffle round his neck, the satin of his knee
breeches, the silk of his stockings, and the shining buckles on his
shoes&mdash;the dress of bygone days. His face was white and dreadful.
As Tom looked he was all at once taken with terror, and ran off as hard
as he could go down the road to Colby.</p>
<p class="par">He had not gone far when he met two of his friends, Ben
Mylechreest and Bill Teare. He told them what he had seen, and they
made fun of him and would not believe that he had seen any such thing.
They said they would go back with him to the gate, so they all three
turned back. When they got to the gate they saw the big man, as tall as
two men, walking up the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>path with his back towards them. As
before, when he reached the door, he turned&mdash;what they saw they
never told any man!</p>
<p class="par">They took to their heels, all three, and ran till they
could run no longer. They were trembling from head to foot and the
sweat pouring from them. They were too terrified to go home, so they
turned in with Tom and they slept, all three, in one bed. <span class=

<h2 class="main">NED QUAYLE&rsquo;S STORY OF THE FAIRY PIG</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When I was a little boy, we lived over by Sloc.
One day, when I was six years old, my mother and my grandmother went up
the mountain to make hay and I was left by myself. It was getting
rather late, and they had not come back, so I was frightened, and
started off up the mountain to try and find them. I had not gone far
when I saw running before me a little snow-white pig. At first I
thought it was some neighbour&rsquo;s pig and I tried to catch it, but
it ran from me and I ran after it. As it went I saw that it was not
like an ordinary pig&mdash;its tail was feathery and spread out like a
fan, and it had long lapping ears that swept the ling. Now and again it
turned its head and looked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>at me, and its eyes were burning
like fire. We went higher and higher up the mountain, and all of a
sudden I found myself at the edge of a steep brow and was all but over.
I turned just in time, and ran as hard as I could go down the mountain
and the pig after me. When I looked back over my shoulder, I saw that
it was jumping over the big stones and rocks on the mountain side as if
they had been butts of ling. I thought it would catch me; it was close
behind me when I ran in at our garden gate, but I was just in time, and
I slammed the door upon it.</p>
<p class="par">I told my mother and my grandmother what had happened,
and my grandmother said it was a Fairy Pig. I was not like myself that
night; I could not eat any supper, and I went soon to my bed; I could
not sleep, but lay tossing about; and was burning hot. After a time my
mother opened the door to see if I was asleep, and when she looked at
me, HER EYES WERE LIKE THE PIG&rsquo;S EYES. I felt a sharp pain go
through my right leg like a stab. After <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>that the pain never
left me; it was so bad that I could not bear to be touched, and I could
eat nothing. I grew worse and worse, and after some days my father said
he would take me to a Charmer at Castletown. They lifted me in the
sheet, four men taking the four corners, and carried me to a cart.
Never will I forget the shaking and jolting I had in that cart. When we
got to Castletown I was more dead than alive.</p>
<p class="par">The Charmer lived in Arbory Street and they took me to
his house. When he saw me he said that they must all go away and leave
me alone with him, so my father and my mother went to wait for me at
The George. The Charmer carried me to a room upstairs and sent his wife
away, and laid me on the floor and locked the door. Then he took down a
big book and placed it on the floor beside me. He opened it at the
picture of a little plant&mdash;I can see the plant to this
day&mdash;and he pointed with his left hand to the picture, and with
his right hand he made the sign of the cross <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>on
my leg, where the stab went through me, and said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Ta mee skeaylley yn guin shoh ayns ennym yn Ayr,

in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Ned
Quayle. If it is a fairy shot, in the name of the Lord, I spread it out
of the flesh, out of the sinews, and out of the bones. That minute the
pain left me. I felt very hungry, and the Charmer&rsquo;s wife set me
at a table and gave me dinner. The Charmer went to fetch my father and
my mother, and when they came in I was eating like two.</p>
<p class="par">The Charmer told my mother I must not go on the mountain
alone between the lights again. The pain never came back. I have been
sound from that day to this, but I have the mark on my leg where the
stab went through as clear as glass to the bone. <span class=

<h2 class="main">KITTERLAND</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was more than eight hundred years ago, in the
days of Olaf Goddardson, that Baron Kitter, the Norwegian, lived in
Mann. He had his castle on the top of Barrule, and he spent all his
time in hunting the bisons and elks that were on the island then, until
he had killed them all. Then the people began to be afraid that he
would chase their cattle and the purrs of the mountains, and leave them
no beasts at all, so they went to the wisest witches of the island, to
see what they could do.</p>
<p class="par">One day Baron Kitter had gone over to the Calf to hunt
the red deer there, leaving his cook, Eaoch of the Loud Voice, in the
castle to cook his dinner. Eaoch set the pot on the fire and then fell
asleep over his work. While he was sleeping the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>witch-wife Ada put a spell on the pot, and the
fat boiled over into the fire. Soon the house was in flames. Eaoch woke
and shouted for help at the top of his voice, and his cries were so
loud that they reached the ears of Kitter and his fellow-huntsmen, ten
miles away on the Calf.</p>
<p class="par">When Kitter heard the cries and saw the flames on the
top of Barrule, he made for the beach as hard as he could, and put out
in a small currach for the island, with most of his friends. When they
were in the strong current about half way across the channel, the boat
struck on a rock and they were all drowned, and the rock has ever since
been called Kitterland. The rest of Kitter&rsquo;s friends, who had
stayed on the Calf and so saved their lives, believed that Eaoch, the
cook, had made a plot with the witches of the island to do away with
all the Norwegians in Mann, so they brought him before King Olaf to be
judged, and he was condemned to death. But according to the custom of
Norway, he was allowed to choose how he would die. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Then he said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I wish my head to be laid across one of your
Majesty&rsquo;s legs, and there cut off by your Majesty&rsquo;s sword
Macabuin, which was made by Loan Maclibuin, the Dark Smith of
Drontheim!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was known to every person there that the king&rsquo;s
sword could cut the hardest granite, only by touching it with its edge,
and they all begged Olaf not to do as crafty Eaoch asked. But the king
would not break his word and gave orders that all should be done as the
cook had said.</p>
<p class="par">But the witch Ada was there and she told them to take
toads&rsquo; skins, twigs of the cuirn tree, and adders&rsquo; eggs,
nine times nine of each, and put them between the king&rsquo;s leg and
the cook&rsquo;s head. They did this, and then the great sword
Macabuin, made by Loan Maclibuin, was lifted with the greatest care by
one of the king&rsquo;s faithful servants and laid gently on the
cook&rsquo;s neck, but before it could be stopped Eaoch&rsquo;s head
was cut from his body and the adders&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>eggs
and the cuirn twigs were also cut through&mdash;only the toads&rsquo;
skins saved the king&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p class="par">When the Dark Smith heard how the power of the great
sword Macabuin had been stayed by witchcraft, he was very angry, and
called for his Hammer-man, Hiallus-nan-urd, who had lost one leg when
he was helping to make the sword. He sent him off at once to Peel
Castle to challenge King Olaf, or any of his men, to a walking race
from Peel to Drontheim. King Olaf himself took up the challenge, and
off they set. Over mountains and through gills they walked, as fast as
they could go, and the one-legged man as fast as the king. When they
had crossed the island they each put out to sea in a sailing boat, and
each came in sight of Drontheim at the same moment. When they drew near
to the smithy, the Hammer-man, who was ahead, called out to Loan to
open the door, and Olaf called to him to shut it, and then, pushing
past Hiallus, got into the smithy first. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">To show that he was not at all weary after his walk Olaf
took up the great hammer of the forge and struck the anvil such a
mighty blow that he split it through, and the block beneath it, too.
When Emergaid, the daughter of Loan, saw the strength and power of
Olaf, she loved him; and while her father was putting back the block
and anvil, she whispered to the king:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;My Father is doing that, so that he may finish
the sword he is making. It has been foretold that the first blood it
shall shed shall be royal blood, and he has sworn that that blood shall
be yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;But is not your father the seventh son of Old
Windy Cap, King of Norway?&rsquo; cried Olaf.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;He is,&rsquo; said Emergaid.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Then the prophecy shall be fulfilled,&rsquo; said
Olaf, and he thrust the sword into the heart of Loan, and afterwards
slew with it the Hammer-man also.</p>
<p class="par">He made Emergaid his queen and they ruled together, and
from them came a long line of Kings of Mann. <span class=

<h2 class="main">TEEVAL, PRINCESS OF THE OCEAN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the old days Culain, the smith of the gods, was
living in the Isle of Mann. It was the time when Conchubar was at the
court of the King of Ulster, and had nothing but the sword in his hand.
He was a fine handsome young man, and he had made up his mind to make
himself a king. So he went one day to the Druid of Clogher to ask him
what he had best do.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Go thy way,&rsquo; said the Druid, &lsquo;to the
Isle of Mann. There thou wilt find the great smith Culain. Get him to
make thee a sword and a spear and a shield, and with these thou shalt
win the kingdom of Ulster.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Conchubar went away, and hired a boat and put out to
sea. He landed in Mann and made straight for Culain&rsquo;s smithy. It
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>was night when he got there, and the red glow of
the furnace shone out into the dark. He could hear from inside the
smithy the roar of the bellows and the clanging of the hammer on the
anvil. When he came near, a great dog, as large as a calf, began to bay
and to growl like thunder, and brought his master out.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Who art thou, young man?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Oh Culain!&rsquo; cried Conchubar, &lsquo;it is
from the Druid of Clogher that I come, and he bade me ask thee to make
me a sword and a spear and a shield, for only with weapons of thy
making can I win the Kingdom of Ulster.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Culain&rsquo;s face grew black at first, but after he
had gazed for a while at Conchubar, he saw that he had the look about
him of one who would go far, and he said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;It shall be done for thee, but thou must wait,
for the work is long.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">So Culain began to make the weapons, and Conchubar
waited in the island.</p>
<p class="par">Early one brave morning in May when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>the
sun had just risen over Cronk-yn-Irree-Laa, he was walking on the
strand, wondering to himself how much longer Culain would be making his
weapons and thinking it was full time for him to return. The tide was
going out, and the sun was shining on the wet sand. Suddenly he saw
something flashing at the edge of the waves a few paces from him. He
ran up to it and, behold, it was the most beautiful woman he had ever
put sight on, fast asleep. Her hair was golden, like the gorse in
bloom; her skin whiter than the foam of the sea, her lips red as the
coral, and her cheeks rosy like the little clouds that were flying
before the face of the rising sun. The fringe of her dress of many
coloured seaweeds rose and fell with the ebb and flow of the waves.
Pearls gleamed on her neck and arms. Conchubar stood and looked on her.
He knew that she was a Mermaid and that as soon as she awoke she would
slip back into the ocean and be lost to him. So he bound her fast with
his girdle.</p>
<p class="par">Then she awoke and opened her eyes, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>which were blue as the sea, and when she saw
that she was bound, she cried out with terror, &lsquo;Loose me, man,
loose me!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Conchubar did not answer, so she said again,
&lsquo;Loose me, I beg thee!&rsquo; in a voice as sweet as the music of
Hom Mooar, the Fairy Fiddler.</p>
<p class="par">By this time Conchubar was feeling that he would give
all he had to keep her. He answered, trembling, &lsquo;Woman, my heart,
who art thou?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I am Teeval, Princess of the Ocean,&rsquo; said
she. &lsquo;Set me free, I pray thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;But if I set thee free,&rsquo; said Conchubar,
&lsquo;thou wilt leave me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I cannot stay with thee, Conchubar,&rsquo; she
cried; &lsquo;set me free, and I will give thee a precious
gift.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I will loose thee,&rsquo; answered Conchubar.
&lsquo;It is not for the gift, but because I cannot resist
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">He unfastened the girdle from her and she said,
&lsquo;My gift to thee is this: Go now to Culain who is making thy
shield, and tell him that Teeval, Princess of the Ocean, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>bids
him to put her figure on the shield and round it to grave her name.
Then thou shalt wear it always in battle, and when thou shalt look on
my face and call my name, thy enemies&rsquo; strength shall go from
them and shall come into thee and thy men.&rsquo; When she had said
this, she waved her white arm to Conchubar and plunged into the waves.
He looked sadly for a long time at the spot where she had disappeared,
and then walked slowly to the forge of Culain, and gave him the
message.</p>
<p class="par">Culain finished the mighty shield as the Princess had
said, and forged also for Conchubar a golden-hilted magic sword, and a
spear set with precious stones. Then Conchubar, in his crimson mantle
and white gold-embroidered tunic, and armed with his great shield and
his mighty weapons, went back to Ireland.</p>
<p class="par">All that the Princess of the Ocean had said came true.
When he went into battle he looked at the beautiful face in his shield
and cried &lsquo;Help, Teeval.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he felt strength come into him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>like
the strength of a giant, and he cut his enemies down like grass. Before
long he was famous all over Ireland for his great deeds, and in the end
he became King of Ulster. Then he invited Culain to come and live in
his kingdom, and gave him the plain of Murthemny to dwell in.</p>
<p class="par">But he never again saw the lovely Mermaid. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE WIZARD&rsquo;S PALACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long hundreds of years ago there was a fine palace
on a mountain sloping up from the sea. It was like a palace in a dream,
built of shining marble of all colours and having great doors covered
with gold.</p>
<p class="par">In it there lived the mighty Wizard who had made it for
himself by his spells. But his hatred of other people was as great as
his power, and he would not allow any person to come near him except
his own servants, and they were evil spirits. If any man dared to go to
see the palace, to ask for work or to beg for charity, he would never
be heard of again. His friends might search for him, but they would
never find him. Soon people began to whisper that some of the blocks of
granite near the palace were like the men who had gone up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>the
mountain and never came back. They began to believe that the Wizard had
caught them and frozen them into grey stone. At length the Wizard
became the terror of the whole island, so that no person would pass
within several miles of his palace. The people of that side of the
island fled from their homes, and the place was lonely and
desolate.</p>
<p class="par">So things went on for three years, until one day a poor
man going on the houses happened to travel on that side of the island,
not knowing anything of this Wizard. His road took him over the
mountain, where the Wizard lived, and as he came near it, he was
astonished to see the place so silent and desolate. He had been looking
forward to the usual food and shelter, with the friendly welcome, but
he found the houses empty ruins and the kindly country people gone. And
where was the straw and hay which made such a snug bed in the barn?
Weeds and stones were lying thick in the fields. Night came on him, and
he walked and walked; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>never a bit of shelter could he
find, and he did not know where to go to get a bed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
middlin&rsquo; dark night,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s
better to go on than back&mdash;a road a body is used on is no throuble
to them, let it be night or not.&rsquo; He was travelling on the old
road over the mountain, going ahead singing &lsquo;Colcheragh
Raby&rsquo; for company to himself, and after a long while he saw a
light in the distance. The light got brighter and brighter until he
came to a grand palace with every window lit up. The singing was all
knocked out of him.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;In the name of Fortune where am I at all? This is
a dreadful big house,&rsquo; he said to himself; &lsquo;where did it
come from, for all? Nobody never seen the like of it on this bare
breas&rsquo; before&mdash;else where am I at all, at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was hard set to get to the door with the blocks of
stone lying about like frozen men.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;d swear,&rsquo; he said to himself as he
stumbled over one, &lsquo;that this was lil&rsquo; Neddy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>Hom,
the dwarf man tha&rsquo;s missin&rsquo;, only it&rsquo;s
stone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">When he came to the big door it was locked. Through one
of the windows he saw a table, and supper ready on it, but he saw no
person. He was very tired and hungry, but he was afraid to knock at the
door of such a fine place.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aw, that place is too gran&rsquo; for the likes
of me!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p class="par">He sat down on one of the marble seats outside,
saying:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stretch meself here till
mornin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a middlin&rsquo; sort of a night.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">That day meat and bread had been given to him at the
last town he had passed through. He was hungry and he thought he would
eat, so he opened his wallet and took out a piece of bread and meat,
then he put his hand into his pocket and drew out a pinch of salt in a
screw of paper. As he opened the paper some grains of salt fell out, on
to the ground. No sooner had this happened than up from the ground
beneath came the sound of most terrible groans, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>high
winds blew from every airt out of the heavens, lightnings flashed in
the air, dreadful thunder crashed overhead, and the ground heaved
beneath his feet; and he knew that there was plenty of company round
him, though no man was to be seen. In less than a moment the grand
palace burst into a hundred thousand bits, and vanished into the air.
He found himself on a wide, lonely mountain, and in the grey light of
dawn no trace of the palace was to be seen.</p>
<p class="par">He went down on his knees and put up a prayer of
thanksgiving for his escape, and then ran on to the next village, where
he told the people all that he had seen, and glad they were to hear of
the disappearance of the Wizard. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Out under the Irish Sea, fifteen or sixteen miles
south-west of the Calf, there is an enchanted isle. Long, long ago it
was on the surface of the water&mdash;that was in the days when
Manannan ruled in Mann&mdash;but when Saint Patrick drove Manannan and
his men from the island in the form of three-legged creatures, they
came upon this isle. Manannan dropped it to the bottom of the sea, and
they were seen no more.</p>
<p class="par">Now it is the home of Manannan Mac y Leirr, Son of the
Sea, and he rules it as he used to rule Mann. But once in seven years,
when Old May Day is on a Sunday, the isle may be seen. It rises up from
the sea just before sunrise, like a beautiful vision, and Manannan
looks once more at Ellan Vannin. The hills of the enchanted isle

Mermaids by the water&rsquo;s edge washing their glittering jewels, and
hear the singing of birds, and smell the fragrant scent of flowers. But
as the first rays of the sun rest upon its highest hills, it sinks into

of them was the cleverest, and it was agreed that the cleverest bird
should be king. The sky was black with them, big and little, and soon
all had gathered together. Everywhere groups of birds sat-a-row,
cooishing, scolding, or sleeping. Some were in fine, black Sunday coats
like old Parson Gull, some clad only in work-a-day brown like Poor
Brownie, the Hedge Sparrow; but most wore leggings of red or yellow,
while the Chough had a new pair of bright red ones. Yellow Tommy, the

bears. When the Cuckoo got up, the Meadow Pipit darted out from a group
and danced round, calling out his name to draw attention to himself,
the little fool, and saying, &lsquo;Let every bird hatch her own
eggs,&rsquo; so poor Cuckoo wasn&rsquo;t heard. There was a loud-voiced
dispute between the Magpie and the Jackdaw as to which was the best
thief. At last little Jinny Wren got up to have her say, after all the
grand ones had done. &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha,&rsquo; laughed the Snipe, and
all the birds chuckled; but Jinny Wren got the better of them for all
that. Says she:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Small though I am and slender my leg,</p>
<p class="line">Twelve chicks I can bring out of the egg.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">And the birds agreed that Jinny was as clever again as
the best of them. But the eagle didn&rsquo;t like it that a little bit
of a bird like Jinny Wren should be over him. So he considered for a
minute, and says he, middling vexed: &lsquo;Birds, it&rsquo;s only
right that the best bird on the wing should be king; let&rsquo;s try a
heat to see which of us can go the highest.&rsquo; Hullad, the Owl,
looked thoughtful, and said: &lsquo;I never saw anything yet worth
flying for.&rsquo; But the birds said: &lsquo;&rsquo;Deed, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea at all.&rsquo; No sooner said than done.
Jinny Diver, the Cormorant, gave the whistle to fly, and instantly off
they started. Speeding on great strong wings, the eagle led the way,
the little ones following, Pompee-ny-Hoarn, Fat bird of the barley,
straggling far in the rear. But the Seven Sleepers, the Bat, the
Stone-chat, Cooag the Cuckoo, and the others, didn&rsquo;t
stir&mdash;the sleep had fallen on them. The Eagle flew up and up and
away, away to the sun, till he couldn&rsquo;t lift a feather an inch
higher. Then he peered down into the blue to the birds far, far below,
and he let a scream out of him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p lang="gv" class="par">&lsquo;Ta mish Ree ny Ein, Ree ny
Ein.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I am King of the Birds, King of the
Birds.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">But little Jinny Wren was one too many for him there
again. She had taken tight hold of him by a feather under his great,
broad wing and hidden herself. And as he cried &lsquo;Ta mish Ree ny
Ein,&rsquo; she flew on top of his head and called out, &lsquo;Cha nel,
cha nel, ta mish er-y-skyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Not so, not so, I&rsquo;m above him, I&rsquo;m
above him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Down dropped the Eagle, and down dropped the Wren,
breathless, but King of the Birds.</p>
<p class="par">And that&rsquo;s why the boys go round on St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Day to this day, singing:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Wren, the Wren, the King of all Birds,</p>
<p class="line">We&rsquo;ve caught St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day in the

<h2 class="main">THE MODDEY DOO OR THE BLACK DOG OF PEEL CASTLE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the days when Charles II was king in England
and Charles, Earl of Derby, king in Mann, Peel Castle was always
garrisoned by soldiers. The guard-room was just inside the great
entrance gate of the castle and a passage used to lead from it, through
one of the old churches, to the Captain of the Guard&rsquo;s room. At
the end of the day one of the soldiers locked the castle gates and
carried the keys through the dark passage to the captain. They would
take it in turns.</p>
<p class="par">About this time one and another began to notice,
sometimes in one room, sometimes in another, a big Black Dog with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>rough curly hair. He did not belong to any
person there, and nobody knew anything about him. But every night when
the candles were lighted in the guard-room and the fire was burning
bright, he would come from the dark passage and lay himself down by the
hearth. He made no sound, but lay there till the break of day, and then
he would get up and disappear into the passage. The soldiers were
terrified of him at first, but after a time they were used to the sight
of him and lost some of their fear, though they still looked on him as
something more than mortal. While he was in the room the men were quiet
and sober, and no bad words were spoken. When the hour came to carry
the keys to the captain, two of them would always go together&mdash;no
man would face the dark passage alone.</p>
<p class="par">One night, however, one foolish fellow had drunk more
than was good for him, and he began to brag and boast that he was not
afraid of the dog. It was not his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>turn to take the keys, but to
show how brave he was he said that he would take them alone. He dared
the dog to follow him.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Let him come,&rsquo; he shouted, laughing;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see whether he be dog or devil!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">His friends were terrified and tried to hold him back,
but he snatched up the keys and went out into the passage.</p>
<p class="par">The Black Dog slowly got up from before the fire and
followed him.</p>
<p class="par">There was a dead silence in the guard-room&mdash;no
sound was heard but the dashing of the waves on the steep rocks of the
Castle Islet.</p>
<p class="par">After a few minutes, there came from the dark passage
the most awful and unearthly screams and howls, but not a soldier dared
to move to see what was going on. They looked at each other in horror.
Presently they heard steps, and the rash fellow came back into the
room. His face was ghastly pale and twisted with fear. He spoke not a
word, then or afterwards. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>In three days he was dead and
nobody ever knew what had happened to him that fearful night.</p>

<h2 class="main">TEHI TEGI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long hundreds of years ago there was a witch in
the island who made herself the finest and cleverest-looking young
woman in it. Her like for beauty was never before seen in this mortal
world. When she went out walking or riding the very birds of the air
would forget to sing for looking at her, and her sweet voice would
tempt them off the trees to listen to her. Even the animals would stand
still till she went by, for her beauty cast a spell on them. And as for
the men, the poor creatures, they flocked from all sides of the island
to woo her, and when they had once looked on her face they never wanted
to leave her. They forgot everything else in the world&mdash;all sorrow
and care, home and country, till at last everything in the island came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>to a standstill because the men followed
wherever this young witch chose to lead them. Their haggards were
empty, for they neither ploughed nor sowed, and their houses tholthans,
for they neither built nor mended. They cut no turf and pulled no ling
for fires. Their fields were covered with stones, so that the cattle
died for want of pasture, and their gardens were full of weeds. There
was a strange stillness throughout the island&mdash;no children&rsquo;s
voices were to be heard anywhere. The witch only laughed to see what
her beauty had done, and she kept all the men near her by making each
think that himself might be the chosen one. If one asked her to marry
him she would answer, &lsquo;An&rsquo; maybe I will,&rsquo; and then
she would say the same to the next. So they spent their days in
pleasuring themselves. When she had made slaves of the men of the
island in this way, she said one day:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Saddle me my horse, for I&rsquo;ve a mind to
ride.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">So they brought her milk-white horse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>shod
with shoes of gold, with bit of gold and bridle set with jewels, with
saddle of mother-of-pearl and saddle-cloth of blue. Tehi Tegi mounted,
and the waves of her golden hair flowed down over her dress of shining
white.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;to the
country for the day, and you can follow me on foot if you
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">She rode and took her way under shady trees and through
grassy lanes, where blue-bells and primroses grew as thick as the
grass, and the hedges were yellow with gorse. She went on by fields,
covered with stones, which were once fine corn land; and on she went at
the head of them by lonely little tholthans whose roofs had sunk in on
the hearth, and then by spots where houses once had been, now marked by
jenny nettles and an old tramman tree. Her way mounted upwards among
hills shining in the May sunlight, and through gills where little
streams ran down between banks covered with fern and briar and many a
flower, to the blue sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At last they found themselves at the side of a bright
swift river, and she put a spell on it and made it seem shallow and as
smooth and clear as glass, so that the little stones at the bottom were
barely covered. Then, when they were all beginning to wade through it,
she took off the spell and the water rushed over their heads and
swallowed up the six hundred poor lovers. With that she made a bat of
herself and rose up in the air and flew out of sight. Her milk-white
horse turned into a perkin, plunged to the bottom of the stream, and
swam away out to sea and was never more seen.</p>
<p class="par">From that time the wise men of the island made their
women go on foot and follow their husbands wherever they should lead,
so that no such accident should happen again. If by chance a woman went
first, anyone who saw her cried out &lsquo;Tehi Tegi! Tehi Tegi!&rsquo;

<h2 class="main">JOHN-Y-CHIARN&rsquo;S JOURNEY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">John-y-Chiarn took the biggest journey in his life
without meaning to do it at all.</p>
<p class="par">One night he was going towards Ballaquirk, taking his
time and thinking of his younger days, when all of a sudden he heard a
great murmur of people coming up behind him, and, before he had time to
look round him, he felt himself getting jostled and a voice asked
him&mdash;middling sharp, too:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;What business have you here in our way at this
hour of the night?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I am sorry to give anyone trouble,&rsquo; said
John; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get over the hedge out of the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then the leader came and touched him with the little
stick he was carrying, and said to the others: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll take him with us; he&rsquo;ll be
useful enough among the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">At that there was a big titter and John felt himself all
altered like, and a thing like a load came on to his back. Then they
all went on together, Themselves talking and laughing away. As soon as
they came near the Ballaragh Chapel though, all was as silent as the
grave. The houses were dark and the only thing they saw stirring was
Quilleash&rsquo;s dog, and as soon as he smelt Themselves he took to
his heels with his tail between his legs.</p>
<p class="par">It was a fine easy night with just a touch of soft fog
on, and a little air coming down from the mountain as we got to
Dreem-y-Cuschaage. There the leader sounded his big ram&rsquo;s horn,
and as they went galloping down to the Dhoon, out came some more of the
Lil Fellas from the gill and joined them, and more talking and laughing
went on. He blew another blast at Ballellin, for there they could see
the fog rolling down from Creg-ny-Molt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Again he blew at Ballagorry and they slacked down a bit,
and you would have thought the whole glen would have wakened up with
the echoes. Down at the bridge they could see the lights going about
like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps. Then the leader shouted:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Get into your lines there, my boys,&rsquo; and
the Maughold Lil Fellas put themselves in rows on the walls of the
bridge, just under the big cherry trees, holding their coloured
lanthorns on the points of their sticks to give light round that dirty
turn; then when all had passed, they joined in and followed behind.
Away they all went, down Slieu Lewaige, fit to break their necks. They
slackened off a bit as they got to Folieu and then took their time as
far as Ballure&rsquo;s Bridge, where there was a big lanthorn hanging
up in a tree over the old mill. As soon as they saw this, two of
Themselves blew horns and then a host of riders came out of the mill,
blowing horns too. They turned up the gill and all of a sudden the
whole crowd, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>with John among them, were right in the middle
of a big camp of the Lil People. There were lights hanging all about in
the trees, and fires blazing under the cowree pots, and musicians
playing fine music. Oh, the taking joy there was! Some were going
round, giving horn-spoons for the cowree and binjean, and then handing
round the oatbread and cheese, and the tramman wine. Then the little
fiddlers and fluters and reed-fellows and the drummers got upon the top
of a big rock, and the Lil Fellas began to dance, till John&rsquo;s
head took the reel watching them. It was a grand sight to see the nice
little girls in their red petticoats, and white stockings and shoes
with silver buckles on, and little bells all tinkling in their hair;
and the Lil Men in their white knee breeches, loghtan stockings and
spotted carranes. In the middle of it all, up came the Lil Captain
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;John,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;What do you think of
this sight, boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s mortal grand,&rsquo; says John.
&lsquo;Far <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>before any of the carnivals I&rsquo;ve seen
before; an&rsquo; how long will it last?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Maybe a fortnight,&rsquo; said he, laughing
heartily. &lsquo;And maybe more, so you would better go back to your
own people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;How&rsquo;ll I get back at all, at all, an&rsquo;
in the dark, too?&rsquo; says John.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Tchut, man,&rsquo; he said, tipping John on the
head with his little stick again.</p>
<p class="par">John didn&rsquo;t remember any more till he wakened at
the break of day close to his own house, and little the worse for his
long journey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=

<h2 class="main">THE WITCH OF SLIEU WHALLIAN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was Midsummer Day, and the Peel Herring Fleet,
with sails half set, was ready for sea. The men had their barley sown,
and their potatoes down, and now their boats were rigged and nets
stowed on board and they were ready for the harvest of the sea. It was
a fine day, the sky was clear and the wind was in the right airt, being
from the north. But, as they say, &lsquo;If custom will not get custom,
custom will weep.&rsquo; A basinful of water was brought from the Holy
Well and given to the Wise Woman that sold fair winds, as she stood on
the harbour-side with the women and children to watch the boats off.
They told her to look and tell of the luck of the Herring Fleet. She
bent over the water and, as she looked, her face grew pale with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>fear, and she gasped: &lsquo;Hurroose, hurroose!
An&rsquo; do ye know what I&rsquo;m seeing?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Let us hear,&rsquo; said they.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m seeing the wild waves lashed to foam away by
great Bradda Head,</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m seeing the surge round the Chicken&rsquo;s
Rock an&rsquo; the breaker&rsquo;s lip is red;</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m seeing where corpses toss in the Sound, with
nets an&rsquo; gear an&rsquo; spars,</p>
<p class="line">An&rsquo; never a one of the Fishing Fleet is riding
under the stars.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">There was a dead hush, and the men gathered close
together, muttering, till Gorry, the Admiral of the Fishing Fleet,
stepped forward, caught the basin out of her hands and flung it out to
sea, growling:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Sure as I&rsquo;m alive, sure as I&rsquo;m alive,
woman, I&rsquo;ve more than half a mind to heave you in after it. If I
had my way, the like of you an&rsquo; your crew would be run into the
sea. Boys, are we goin&rsquo; to lose a shot for that bleb? Come on,
let&rsquo;s go an&rsquo; chonce it with the help of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Aye, no herring, no wedding. Let&rsquo;s go
an&rsquo; chonce it,&rsquo; said young Cashen.</p>
<p class="par">So hoisting sails they left the port and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>when
the land was fairly opened out, so that they could see the Calf, they
headed for the south and stood out for the Shoulder. Soon a fine breeze
put them in the fishing-ground, and every man was looking out for signs
of herring&mdash;perkins, gannets, fish playing on the surface, oily
water, and such like. When the sun was set and the evening was too dark
to see the Admiral&rsquo;s Flag, the skipper of each lugger held his
arm out at full length, and when he could no longer see the black in
his thumb-nail he ordered the men to shoot their nets. And as they lay
to their trains it all fell out as the witch had said. Soon the sea put
on another face, the wind from westward blew a sudden gale and swelled
up the waves with foam. The boats were driven hither and thither, and
the anchors dragged quickly behind them. Then the men hoisted sail
before the wind and struggled to get back to land, and the lightning
was all the light they had. It was so black dark that they could see no
hill, and above the uproar of the sea they could hear the surges
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>pounding on the rocky coast. The waves were
rising like mountains, breaking over the boats and harrying them from
stem to stern. They were dashed to pieces on the rocks of the Calf, and
only two men escaped with their lives.</p>
<p class="par">But there was one boat that had got safe back to port
before the storm, and that was the boat of the Seven Boys. She was a
Dalby boat and belonged to seven young men who were all unmarried. They
were always good to the Dooinney Marrey, the Merman, and when they were
hauling their nets they would throw him a dishful of herring, and in
return they had always good luck with their fishing. This night, after
the Fleet had shot their nets sometime, the night being still fine and
calm, the Seven Boys heard the voice of the Merman hailing them and
saying:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;It is calm and fine now; there will be storm
enough soon!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">When the Skipper heard this he said: &lsquo;Every
herring must hang by its own gills,&rsquo; and he and his crew at once
put their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>nets on board and gained the harbour. And it was
given for law ever after that no crew was to be made up of single men
only; there was to be at least one married man on board and no man was
bound by his hiring to fish in this same south sea, which was called
&lsquo;The Sea of Blood&rsquo; from that day.</p>
<p class="par">As for the witch, they said she had raised the storm by
her spells and they took her to the top of the great mountain Slieu
Whallian, put her into a spiked barrel and rolled her from the top to
the bottom, where the barrel sank into the bog. For many and many a
long year there was a bare track down the steep mountain-side, where
grass would never grow, nor ling, nor gorse. They called it &lsquo;The

<h2 class="main">THE OLD CHRISTMAS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the days of our grandmothers, Old Christmas
Day, the fifth of January, was believed to be the true Christmas. On
Black Thomas&rsquo;s Eve, which was the first day of the Christmas
holidays, the spinning wheels all had to be put away, the making of
nets ceased, and no work of any kind must be done until after Twelfth
Day.</p>
<p class="par">But there was once an old woman named Peggy Shimmin, at
Ballacooil, and she was bent on finishing some spinning that she had
begun, so on Old Christmas Eve she said to herself:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;The New Christmas is pas&rsquo; an&rsquo; surely
it&rsquo;s no wrong to do a bit o&rsquo; spinning to-night,&rsquo;
though she doubted in her heart if she were not sinning. So when
Himself and the rest were in bed, she called her young servant-girl,
lil Margad, and said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Margad, me an&rsquo; you will finish the spinning
to-night.&rsquo; Margad was frightened, terrible, but she got out her
wheel and sat beside her mistress. The two began to spin, and they were
spinning and spinning till near midnight, and behold ye, just before
midnight old Peggy saw the flax she was drawing from the distaff grow
blacker and blacker till it was as black as tar. But Margad&rsquo;s
flax did not change colour because she had only done what her mistress
bade her. Peggy dropped the flax quick, put away her wheel, and crept
in fear to bed. She knew now which was the true Christmas Day and never
more did she spin on Old Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="par">Margad was left alone in the kitchen when her mistress
had gone to bed, and at first she was trembling with fright; but she
was a middling brave girl, and she took a notion, as there was no
person to stop her, to see if all the things were true that she had
heard about Old Christmas Eve. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151"
href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;They&rsquo;re saying,&rsquo; she thought,
&lsquo;that the bees are coming out, an&rsquo; the three-year-old
bullocks going down on their knees, an&rsquo; the myrrh coming up in
bloom.&rsquo; Then she says to herself:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll go out an&rsquo;
watch the myrrh.&rsquo; So she put a cloak round her and crept out at
the door into the cold frosty moonlit night, and midnight had just
struck as she put her foot outside. She stooped to look on the spot
where the myrrh root was buried, and as she was looking, the earth
began to stir and to crack, and soon two little green shoots pushed up
to the air. She bent closer to see what would happen, and to her great
wonder the leaves and stalks grew big and strong before her eyes, and
then the buds began to show, and in a few minutes the lovely white
flowers were in bloom and the garden was sweet with their fragrance.
Margad could do nothing but stare at them at first, but at last she
dared to gather one small piece of the blossom, and she kept it for
luck all her life. Then she went to the cowhouse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>and
peeped through the door. She heard a groaning sound and there were the
young bullocks on their knees, moaning, and the sweat was dropping from
them. Margad knelt down, too, and put up a bit of a prayer to the Holy
Child that was born in a stall. But the wonders were not over yet, for
as she went silently back to the house she noticed that the bees were
singing and flying round the hive&mdash;they were inside again, when
she shut the door of the house behind her.</p>
<p class="par">Always after that, when the neighbours would ask her if
she believed in the wonders of the Old Christmas Eve, she would
say:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I know it&rsquo;s true, for I&rsquo;ve seen it
myself.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=

<h2 class="main">THE BUGGANE OF ST. TRINIAN&rsquo;S</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A long time ago there came some monks to the
broad, rough meadow which is between dark Greeba Mountain and the high
road, and they chose a nice place and set up a church to St. Trinian on
it. But they reckoned without the power of the Buggane, who had his
haunt in the mountain. The Buggane was mighty angry, and he said to
himself:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have no peace night or day with their
jingling bells if I let them finish the building.&rsquo; And, as he had
nothing else to do, he took it into his head to amuse himself by
tossing off the roof.</p>
<p class="par">So when the roof of the church was first put on, there
was heard that very night a dreadful sound in it, and when the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>people of Greeba got up early next morning they
found their church roofless, and planks and broken beams all around the
place. After a time, and with great effort, the roof was put on again.
But when it was on, a great storm arose in the night and it was blown
down from the walls, exactly as had happened before. This fall put fear
in the people, for they were sure now that it was the evil, destructive
Buggane himself that was doing the mischief. But, though they were
terrified, they resolved to make one more attempt; and the third roof
was nearly finished.</p>
<p class="par">Now there was a brave little tailor living about a mile
from Greeba, and because he had not too much worldly gear, he made a
wager that when the new roof was on, he would not only spend the first
night in the church, but also make a pair of breeches there. The wager
was taken up eagerly, as they hoped that if the roof was one night up,
it would be left on.</p>
<p class="par">So Timothy&mdash;that was the name of the little
tailor&mdash;went to the church on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>very first evening
after the new roof had been put on. He started just when the shadow was
beginning to get grey by the hedges. He took with him cloth, needle and
thread, thimble and scissors. He entered the church boldly, lit a
couple of big candles, and looked all over the building to see that
everything was right. Then he locked the door so that there was no way
to get in. He cut out the cloth, and, seating himself cross-legged in
the chancel, he put on his thimble and set to work at the breeches. He
paid no heed to the darkness of the lonely church at dead of night, but
with long thread and needle he bent low over his work, his fingers,
moving backwards and forwards rapidly, casting strange, beckoning
shadows on the walls. The breeches had got to be finished, or he would
lose his wager, so he stitched away as fast as he could, thinking about
the good money the people would have to give him.</p>
<p class="par">The wind was beginning to rise, and trees scutched their
arms against the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>windows. The tailor looked cautiously up
and down and round about. Nothing strange came in sight and he took
courage. Then he threaded his needle and began his work again. He gave
another sharp glance around, but saw nothing at all except the glimmer
of the place near the candles, and empty, deep darkness away beyond
them. So his courage rose high, and he said to himself:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all foolishness that&rsquo;s at the
people about the Buggane, for, after all, the like isn&rsquo;t
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">But at that very minute the ground heaved under him and
rumbling sounds came up from below. The sounds grew louder underneath,
and Timothy glanced quickly up. All of a sudden a great big head broke
a hole through the pavement just before him, and came slowly rising up
through the hole. It was covered with a mane of coarse, black hair; it
had eyes like torches, and glittering sharp tusks. And when the head
had risen above the pavement, the fiery eyes glared fiercely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>at Tim; the big, ugly, red mouth opened wide,
and a dreadful voice said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Thou rascal, what business hast thou
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tim paid no heed, but worked harder still, for he knew
he had no time to lose.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Dost thou see this big head of mine?&rsquo;
yelled the Buggane.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I see, I see!&rsquo; replied Tim, mockingly.</p>
<p class="par">Up came a big broad pair of shoulders, then a thick arm
shot out and a great fist shook in the Tailor&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Dost thou see my long arms?&rsquo; roared the
voice.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I see, I see!&rsquo; answered Tim, boldly, and he
stopped his tailoring to snuff one of the guttering candles, and he
threw the burning snuff in the scowling face before him. Then he went
on with his tailoring.</p>
<p class="par">The Buggane kept rising and rising up through the hole
until the horrible form, black as ebony, and covered with wrinkles like
the leather of a blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows, had risen quite out of the
ground.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Dost thou see this big body of mine?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>roared the Buggane, angry that Tim showed no
fear of him.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I see, I see!&rsquo; replied the Tailor, at the
same time stitching with all his might at the breeches.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Dost thou see my sharp claws?&rsquo; roared the
Buggane in a more angry voice than before.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I see, I see!&rsquo; answered again the little
Tailor, without raising his eyes, and continuing to pull out with all
his might.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Dost thou see my cloven foot?&rsquo; thundered
the Buggane, drawing up one big foot and planking it down on the
pavement with a thud that made the walls shake.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I see, I see!&rsquo; replied the little Tailor,
as before, stitching hard at the breeches and taking long stitches.</p>
<p class="par">Lifting up his other foot, the Buggane, in a furious
rage, yelled:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Dost thou see my rough arms, my bony fingers, my
hard fists, my&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Before he could utter another syllable, or pull the
other foot out of the ground, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159"
href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>the little Tailor quickly
jumped up, and made two stitches together. The breeches were at last
finished, then with one spring he made a leap through the nearest
window. But scarcely was he outside the walls when down fell the new
roof with a terrible crash, that made Tim jump a great deal more nimbly
than he ever did before. Hearing the Buggane&rsquo;s fiendish guffaws
of laughter behind him, he took to his heels and sped hot-foot along
the Douglas road, the breeches under his arms and the furious Buggane
in full chase. The Tailor made for Marown Church, only a little
distance away, and knew he would be safe if he could only reach the
churchyard. He ran faster still, he reached the wall, he leaped over it
like a hunted hare, and fell weary and spent upon the grass, under the
shadow of the church, where the Buggane had not power to follow.</p>
<p class="par">So furious was the monster at this that he seized his
own head with his two hands, tore it off his body and sent it flying
over the wall after the Tailor. It burst at his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>feet
with a terrific explosion, and with that the Buggane vanished, and was
never seen or heard of afterwards. Wonderful to relate, the Tailor was
not hurt, and he won the wager, for no person grumbled at the few long
stitches put into the breeches.</p>
<p class="par">And as for St. Trinian&rsquo;s Church, there is no name
on it from that day till this but Keeill Vrisht&mdash;Broken
Church&mdash;for its roof was never replaced. There it stands in the
green meadow under the shadow of rocky Greeba Mountain, and there its
grey roofless ruins are to be found now. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">KING MAGNUS BAREFOOT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Magnus, great nephew of Olaf the Saint, was King
of Norway in the days when the Norwegian Kings were Lords over Mann,
and he was called by the name of Barefoot because he wore kilts. He was
the bravest and most beautiful young king of his time&mdash;tall and
strong and brilliant as a meteor. He wore a helmet on his head and
carried a red shield with a golden lion upon it; he had in his belt a
sword of exceeding sharpness with an ivory hilt inlaid with gold, and a
keen javelin in his hand. Over his coat of mail was a tunic of ruby-red
embroidered with a golden lion. He was a fine and valiant figure. It
was he who brought King Olaf&rsquo;s Cup of Peace to our island, and
this is the way it happened.</p>
<p class="par">Magnus was sitting at supper one day <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>with
his chief men, and their talk ran on the beautiful shrine of Olaf the
Saint, which was the wonder of its age. They spake to one another of
how it was said that Olaf&rsquo;s body would never be destroyed by
death, but would remain as in life and would heal those who prayed at
the shrine of any sickness. Magnus laughed the story to scorn and said
boldly:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Seeing is believing; let the shrine be opened
that we may see for ourselves if the story be true.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then the bishop and clergy were horrified, and begged
the king: &lsquo;Oh king, let not the thing be done, it will surely
bring evil on thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">But Magnus commanded:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Let the shrine be opened at once. I fear no man
alive or dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">So his will was done and when the jewelled shrine was
opened, all saw the body of holy Olaf lying incorrupt and fair as if
alive. Magnus touched it with his hands, but was suddenly seized with a
great fear. He went away in haste, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>took with him the
lovely crystal cup that lay beside the Saint.</p>
<p class="par">The next night in his sleep he had a vision of King
Olaf, majestic and stern, who said to him:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Choose, I tell you, one of two things, either to
lose your kingdom and life within thirty days, or to leave Norway and
never see it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Magnus awoke and called his chiefs and great men to tell
them of his vision.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Oh king,&rsquo; they cried in fear. &lsquo;Leave
Norway with all speed, and keep thy life and kingship.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">So Magnus, who was the last of our great Sea Kings, got
together a fleet of 160 long ships, each with twenty or thirty
rowers&rsquo; benches, and with bows carved in the shape of dragons. He
loved the sea, and, like a true Viking, he used to say:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I will never sleep under a sooty rafter nor drink
in the chimney corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Away he sailed to the Orkneys; he conquered them and all
the Western Islands, and came to Mann. He put in at Saint <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>Patrick&rsquo;s Isle and went to see the site of
the Battle of Santwat near Peel, which had been fought three days
before between the Manx of north and south. The beauty of our island
pleased his eyes and he chose it for his dwelling-place. He made the
men of Galloway cut timber and bring it over to make three forts for
him. In one of them, near Douglas, he placed the Cup of Peace, which he
knew would be well guarded by the Lhiannan Shee, the Peace Fairy who
never left it.</p>
<p class="par">Then he sailed to Anglesey and made himself lord over
it, but he soon came back to the Isle of Mann, for it pleased him best.
On his return he sent his dirty shoes over to Morrough, King of
Ireland, with this message:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway and the Isles,
bids thee carry his dirty shoes on thy shoulders through thy house on
Christmas Day in thy royal state, and own that thou hast thy kingdom
and power from the Lord of Norway and the Isles. And this thou must do
in sight of his envoys.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"
href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When the Irish heard this they were furiously angry and
indignant, but wise King Morrough said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;I will not only carry the shoes, but eat them,
rather than that Magnus should ruin a single province in
Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he carried the shoes on Christmas Day as Magnus
bade, treated the messengers with honour and sent them back to Mann
with many fine gifts for their king, with whom he made a treaty of
peace. But the envoys told their master of the richness of the Irish
lands and the pleasantness of the air, and Magnus kept it in his
mind.</p>
<p class="par">After this the King of Scotland sent a message to him,
saying:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Cease to make war against me and I will yield
thee those of the Western Isles that thou canst from the mainland go
round in a vessel with a paddle-rudder.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Magnus made peace on those terms and so the Norse Kings
gained the Southern Isles, among which they counted the peninsula of
Cantyre because Magnus, sitting at the helm, caused his great warship
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>be dragged across the neck of land which joins
it to the mainland. His vikings shouted with triumph as they pulled the
ship along, with their young king in his red and gold laughing at the
stern.</p>
<p class="par">But all this time, in his heart, Magnus could think of
nothing but the conquest of Ireland. He sailed to the coast of Down,
where he began to invade and pillage. It was on Saint
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day, 1103, that his last battle was fought. The
Irish had promised to bring him cattle for his troops the day before,
but as they had not come he landed his men and marched them to the top
of a little hill on the plain of Coba. From this place he could see all
the country round, and presently there appeared a great cloud of dust
in the distance. Some of his men said that it was an army approaching,
others that it was the herd of cattle. The last were right, and when
the cattle had been handed over, Magnus and his men returned towards
his ships. It was now the noon of a calm and sunny day. When they
reached the marshes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>suddenly a band of Irish rushed out from
their ambush in a wood close by, and attacked them fiercely.</p>
<p class="par">Magnus ordered his chief, Eyvinder, to sound the trumpet
and summon his men around the royal standard. He ordered them to close
ranks with overlapping shields, until they got to the dry ground where
they would be safe. They made their way as far as an old fort, but the
Irish pressed them and slew many of them. Then the king called to a
chief named Thorgrim:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Do you, with your cohort, cross the rampart and
occupy the hill opposite with your archers till we join you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Thorgrim and his men did as they were told and crossed
over, but when they were across they put their shields on their backs
and fled to the ships. When Magnus saw them he shouted:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Is it thus you run, you coward? I was a fool to
send you instead of Sigurd, who would not thus desert me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Magnus fought like a lion, but soon he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>was
pierced through the thigh by a spear. He pulled it out and snapped it
beneath his feet, crying:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Thus we, young warriors, break these twigs. Fight
on bravely, my men, and fear no danger for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">His men prayed him to try to spare himself, but he
said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Better for a people to have a brave king than an
old king!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And so saying, foremost in the battle, he met his death.

<h2 class="main">MANANNAN MAC Y LEIRR</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Manannan Mac y Leirr, the Son of the Sea, was the
first Ruler of Mann. He was a great Wizard, and he was so powerful that
afterwards he was looked on as a god. He had a great stone fort on Peel
Island, and he could make one man, standing on its battlements, seem to
be a hundred. When he saw his enemies&rsquo; ships sailing, he would
cover the island round with a silver mist so that it could not be seen;
and if, in spite of the mist, his enemies came near, he would throw
chips into the water and change them into ships. He was out walking one
day on Barrule, when he saw the warships of the Northmen were in the
bay of Peel. And with that he made himself into the shape of three legs
and rolled like a wheel down from the mountain top as fast as the wind.
It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>was about low tide in the harbour, and there ran
a stream of sparkling water out to sea. Now the banks of the stream
were marshy, and by the river-side grew a quantity of sedge with broad,
green leaves. So Manannan made little boats of the sedge, a good number
of them, and sailed his boats in the stream. And when the little fleet
floated out of the harbour, he caused them to look like great ships of
war, well manned with fighting men. Then terror seized on the Northmen
when they saw the Manx fleet, and they cut their cables, hoisted sails,
and cleared away as fast as they could, and Manannan and his island
were left in peace. Thus did he keep Mann, and not with his sword, or
his bow and arrows.</p>
<p class="par">In his fort he had a great banqueting-hall, where
handsome boys made sweet music, and others played games and did great
feats of strength. He had a horse called Enbarr of the Flowing Mane,
who could travel like the wind over sea as well as land, swift hounds
that could catch any wild beast, and a sword called The Answerer,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>whose wound was always fatal, besides his Magic
Branch and his wonderful boat, Wave Sweeper.</p>
<p class="par">He governed Mann well for long, long years. Manx people
had the best of good treatment from him, and all the rent he wanted was
that each one was to bring a bundle of green rushes to him on the
Mountain of South Barrule on Midsummer Eve. The island was a happy
place, full of sunshine and all pleasant things, and no person there
was old or tired or sad.</p>
<p class="par">Manx men have never forgotten Manannan, and this
thousand years our fishermen have prayed to him the following prayer,
as they have put out to sea. Even up to the days of our fathers it has
been used:</p>

<h2 class="main">THE CORMORANT AND THE BAT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There was a time in the olden days when the
cormorant and the bat took counsel together to do something for the
poor, as they had compassion on them, and they went into the glens
gathering wool to make clothing for them. When they had a quantity
gathered they took a boat and put out to sea. It happened as they were
sailing that a storm came on, and the waves were breaking over the
vessel, insomuch that the poor bat had to leap from place to place to
escape the water, and in the darkness he was cast out of the boat
clinging to an oar. At daybreak he was near the shore and flew unto dry
land. A seagull, standing near by, inquired:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Och, lil bat vogh, what&rsquo;s there doin on
thee that thou are all of a thriddle <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>of thrimblin like
this?&rsquo; When he heard the bat&rsquo;s story, he said:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;As sure as can be, if he will happen on thee, he
will take thy life.&rsquo; They had given each other a promise that one
would not leave the other until they had completed their task.</p>
<p class="par">The bat was so frightened that he hid himself in an old
ruin until the darkness came on; and from that time until now he will
only venture out under covering of the night.</p>
<p class="par">The cormorant held on to the boat until she filled with
water and sank to the bottom of the sea. At last he flew to a rock, and
there sat for hours together, day after day, looking out for the bat.
At other times he would go for a season into the glens; and in this way
they continue from that storm to the present time&mdash;the one hides
himself, and the other seeks him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176"

<h2 class="main">CAILLAGH-NY-FAASHAGH, OR THE PROPHET WIZARD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the old days when there were wizards and
witches in the Isle of Mann, the greatest Wizard of all was
Caillagh-ny-Faashagh. He did not live above ground, but in a quarry, in
a hole under the rock on the lonely mountain side, and that is why the
people called him the Prophet Wizard of the Wilderness. At dark he
would roam over the mountains, and people walking there, when night was
drawing on, would hear him crying &lsquo;Hoa, hoa, hoa!&rsquo; like the
bellow of a goat, in a voice so terrible and strong that the earth, and
all who heard it, trembled with fear. He could change himself into any
shape he liked; sometimes he would be a goat with big, fiery eyes; at
other times a tall, tall man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177"
href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>Once, when he was a goat, he
followed a man that was walking along the mountain road, and that time
he had eyes in him as big as two dishes. The man was carrying a
lantern, and as he shifted it from one hand to the other the goat
followed it from side to side. The man was terrified and began to run.
As soon as he left the mountain road the beast roared after him:
&lsquo;Hoa, hoa, hoa!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Another time, in the shape of a tall, tall man, as tall
as two men, he followed a woman who struck across the mountain at Garey
mooar, and he had great, big, burning eyes, as big as two plates, in
his head. The woman ran with all her might, for life or death, and he
ran roaring after her: &lsquo;Hoa, hoa, hoa!&rsquo; But when she turned
down from the mountain he came no further.</p>
<p class="par">He was a great soothsayer, but he would not foretell
what was to happen unless some person asked him. It seems that he must
have lived for hundreds of years, for he foretold a battle that was
fought in 1098. This was the Battle of Santwat, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>&lsquo;Sand Ford,&rsquo; between the north and
south Manx. He said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The river Neb shall run red from Glen Crew to the
sea,</p>
<p class="line">And gulls shall sip their full of the blood of
Manninee.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">It all came true. The north men sailed into Peel
and ran their flat-bottomed boats up to Glenfaba Ford, where the south
men met them to keep them from landing. They fought up the stream to
Glen Crew where there was a great slaughter, and the bodies of the
slain dammed the stream and turned the little glen into a pool. The
waters of the Neb were reddened by Manx blood when they ran into Peel
Bay. The south side women had followed the men and were watching the
battle from a little distance, but when they saw that the north people
were winning they rushed down, and into the heart of the fight, with
bratfuls of stones and with hacks, and won the day for the south. And a
law was made that henceforth the widows in the south of the island
should get half of their husband&rsquo;s estate; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>but
the north side women, who stayed at home, were to get only
one-third.</p>
<p class="par">The Prophet Wizard foretold, too, the finding of Foxdale
lead mines. A man came to him and asked:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;How will I get rich, O
Caillagh-ny-Faashagh?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">And the Wizard answered:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">There&rsquo;s a butt in Ballafesson worth the whole of
Balladoole.</p>
<p class="line">But the riches of the Isle of Mann lie hid behind
Barrule.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">He also gave this prophecy to old Juan the weaver,
who asked him for one:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">At the foot of Barrule there will be a market town,</p>
<p class="line">Mullin-y-Cleigh with blood for twenty-four hours will
turn roun&rsquo;.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Now the village of Foxdale stands at the foot of
Barrule, and it is said that in the old times a great battle between
the Manx and the Irish was fought by the stream above Mullin-y-Cleigh,
the Mill-by-the-Hedge.</p>
<p class="par">To a Peel man he foretold:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;There will be a battle between the Irish and the
Manx at Creg Malin.&rsquo; And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180"
href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>the old fishermen say that
that battle took place two hundred years ago. It was a Sunday when the
Irishmen came in the bay, and they found no place to beach their boats,
so they turned the Manx boats adrift, and thought they had the place
for themselves. But they soon found their masters. The Manx men came
after their boats, and there was the battle&mdash;red blood running
like water! And the battle was not over that day, but they fought round
into Douglas, and finished at last in Derby Haven, so the old fishermen
say.</p>
<p class="par">Then there was an old maid that had a cressad (a melting
pot), and she went from house to house making lead spoons. She was a
bit queer; she would not smoke a mould on a sunny day, nor a misty day,
nor a wet day, nor a windy day; she must have a day to fit herself. She
met the Caillagh when he was in the shape of a goat, and she asked him
to foretell when would be the end of the world. He said that before the
last:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;The Mountains of Mann will be cut <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>over
with roads, and iron horses will gallop over them, and there will be an
inn on the top of Snaefell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">That has all come true; trains rush over the island and,
for sure, there is the inn on the top of our highest mountain. He said,
too:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Mann and Scotland will come so close that two
women, one standing in Mann and another in Scotland, will be able to
wring a blanket between them.&rsquo; But that has not come true yet,
though the sandy Point of Ayre is stretching further and further
towards the Mull of Galloway.</p>
<p class="par">And another of his prophecies has not come to pass
yet:</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;The Chief Rulers of Mann will be compelled to
flee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">But it will all be before the end. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">THE CITY UNDER SEA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Now where Langness runs its long nose into the
sea, and on a place now always covered by the waves, there was once a
fine city with many towers and gilded domes. Great ships went sailing
from its port to all parts of the world, and round it were well-grassed
lands with cattle and sheep. Even now sailors sometimes see it through
the clear, deep waters, and hear dimly the bleating of sheep, the
barking of dogs, and the muffled chiming of bells&mdash;&lsquo;Nane,
jees, three, kiare, queig.&rsquo; But no man can walk its streets.</p>
<p class="par">For once upon a time, in the days when there were giants
in the Isle of Mann, Finn Mac Cool had his home near this city. He
lived at the Sound to keep his eye on Erinn, and to watch the sea. But
he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>very seldom in Mann, and wherever he was he was
always doing some mischief, so that his enemies were many. One day he
was in such a hurry to reach his home that he jumped from Erinn and
landed in the island on the rocks above the Sound. He came down with
such force that he left his footmarks in the hard stone, and the place
has been called ever since, Slieu ynnyd ny Cassyn, or the Mountain of
the place of the Feet. His first act when he reached home was to get in
a red rage with the people of the city close by; his next act was to
turn them all into blocks of granite. In his passion he struck the
ground so hard with his club that he made a great dent in it&mdash;the
waves rushed into the deep hollow and the roaring sea drowned the din
of the city. Its towers and domes were covered by the green water; its
streets and market-place, its harbour and its crowded quays,
disappeared from sight. And there it lies to this day.</p>
<p class="par">But there is a strange story told of a man that went
down to it more than two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>hundred years ago. A ship was
searching for sunken treasure in those parts and this man was let down
to the bottom of the sea in a kind of ancient diving bell. He was to
pull the rope when he wished to be let down further. He pulled and
pulled till the men on the ship knew that he was as deep down in the
sea as the moon is high up in the sky; then there was no more rope and
they had to draw him up again. When he was on deck he told them that if
he could have gone further he would have made the most wonderful
discoveries. They begged him to tell them what he had seen, and when he
had drunk a cup of wine he told his story.</p>
<p class="par">First he had passed through the waters in which the
fishes live; then he came into the clear and peaceful region where
storms never come, and saw the bottom of the World-under-Sea shining
with coral and bright pebbles. When the diving bell rested on the
ground he looked through its little windows and saw great streets
decorated with pillars of crystal glittering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>like
diamonds, and beautiful buildings made of mother-of-pearl, with shells
of every colour set in it. He longed to go into one of these fine
houses, but he could not leave his diving bell, or he would have been
drowned. He managed to move it close to the entrance of a great hall,
with a floor of pearls and rubies and all sorts of precious stones, and
with a table and chair of amber. The walls were of jasper, and strings
of lovely jewels were hanging on them. The man wished to carry some
away with him, but he could not reach them&mdash;the rope was at an
end. As he rose up again towards the air he met many handsome Mermen
and beautiful Mermaids, but they were afraid of him, and swam away as
fast as they could.</p>
<p class="par">That was the end of the man&rsquo;s story. After that he
grew so sad with longing to go back to the World-under-Sea and stay
there for ever, that he cared for nothing on earth, and soon died of
grief. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
